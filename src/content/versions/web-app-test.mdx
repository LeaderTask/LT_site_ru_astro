## Even more flexibility when working with tasks:

* Transfer tasks from search directly to your calendar — plan twice as fast, without unnecessary switching between sections
* Create subtasks with Alt + "+" — break down complex projects into stages in seconds
* Complete tasks via Telegram — keep your workflows under control through your familiar messenger without opening the main application
* Import from Yandex Calendar — combine all your meetings and deadlines in a single system
* Plan a year ahead — ideal for strategic goals and long-term projects
