Half of success in any business is determined by proper goal setting, and this
is by no means an easy task. Today, businesses use various techniques to help
them achieve their goals. However, for example, when
using SMART, KPI, Agile or SCRUM such a result is achieved mainly due to
optimisation of work processes and increasing the importance of horizontal
connections.

A distinctive feature of OKR, however, is the synchronisation of team activities
with strategic goals. As a result, employees put as much effort as possible into
achieving OKR business goals. Initially, the concept of OKR goals originated at
Intel, and then it was adopted by John Doerr from Google. Today, OKR is actively
used by well-known companies such as LinkedIn, Uber and many others.

## What is OKR

OKR - Objectives and Key Results - is a management and goal-setting system that
enables the harmonisation of actions at different levels between departments,
teams and employees. It is achieved through transparency and a clear hierarchy.
Objectives do not refer to examples of goals, but to directions in which to
move - guiding stars. They can be abstract and represent an image of the future
to which the company aspires. At the same time, Objectives can be concrete. What
they will be depends on the chosen strategy and vision of the organisation. Key
Results - measurable indicators that allow you to know whether the objectives
have been achieved or not. Most often metrics and numbers are used for this
purpose. Ideally, key indicators should be SMART, i.e. specific, measurable,
achievable, justifiable and time-bound.

This method helps to focus attention during planning on the most important
things. OKR allows you to set clear priorities for goal achievement and manage
the actions of employees. Encourage staff to look for out-of-the-box solutions,
to work together and to communicate. OKR works like a hierarchy in an
organisation. The strategic goals of the company determine the direction of the
individual departments and teams, from which the individual tasks of the
employees will emerge in the future. The hierarchy is both vertical and
horizontal, which helps to increase team involvement and the efficiency of
teamwork;

OKR is a way of goal setting that consists of two elements. The company should
set targets for growth. It is considered a success if the set "targets" are
achieved by 70-75%. If 100% is achieved, then this condition may be due to the
fact that the targets are set low on purpose. Objectives - super-objectives.

You can use one or more Key Results to monitor progress, but no more than five.
The best option is to work with 2-3 metrics. The fewer there are, the better, as
it is easier to keep tasks in focus.

## Where to start

![Where to start OKR](/image.webp)

Setting OKR is a two-way process, so all employees are involved in the
discussion and goal-setting phase. During OKR work, communication takes place in
three directions:

1.  **Top-down**. Global strategic objectives descend on the OKRs of
    departments, teams and employees. This scenario may involve setting
    objectives based on needs.

2.   **Side-by-side**. Divisions and teams come together to set common OKRs,
    complementing top-down goals. This is a scenario of defining OKRs through
    collaboration.

3.  **Bottom-up**. If someone has a valuable idea, it can be proposed as an OKR.
    Suggestions from employees turn into goals that can be used at any level of
    the hierarchy. This rarely happens in practice. This option involves goal
    setting from decisions.

It is assumed that 50 percent of the objectives will be created top-down and the
other 50 percent bottom-up. During the OKR setting phase, a key task for
management is to get a shared understanding of the prioritised objectives. Some
ideas may be more important than others, and understanding this will save a lot
of time. If workers are aware of the key targets, it will be easier for them to
drop lower priority things and focus on the really important ones.

Don't expect every department to support global initiatives. Departments have
their own specificity and specialisation, which affects the adoption of certain
business goals. For example, the marketing department is unlikely to support the
goal of reducing production costs, as this goal is outside their area of
responsibility. In addition to strategic objectives, teams and departments
should have their own localised objectives. Firstly, at each level of the
hierarchy there are opportunities for growth and OKR adjustments. Secondly,
focusing only on global aspirations can cause misunderstandings and disruptions
in the field;

## OKR principles

**Focus.** In contrast to classical goal-setting methods, OKR suggests focusing
on what is most important. In a given time period, such as a quarter or a year,
there can be as few as two to five goals with a maximum of five key results for
each. With a limited number, it is much easier to achieve a single direction for
all, and efforts are focussed on what is most important to the business.

**Ambition**. Benchmarks should be ambitious and inspiring. If you met the plan
100%, it means you set low expectations, and if less than 30%, they were too
high. Your results should be between 60-70%.

**No tie to salaries and bonuses**. This aspect echoes the previous one. By
tying goals to financial bonuses, you may run into a situation where most team
members purposely underperform in order to get it. OKR requires independence
from salaries and any kind of bonuses. But it does not mean that you should
cancel the very possibility of bonuses for good performance of staff. The
manager should reward without being tied to metrics.

**Synchronisation and transparency.** OKRs, departments and teams should be made
publicly available to the organisation's staff. Transparency will help improve
team communication, and it will be easier to harmonise work and set common
goals. Synchronisation will keep the company moving in the same direction. If a
goal is no longer a priority, the organisation can quickly realign itself. The
link between the work of an individual employee and the business strategy
increases the productivity of the entire company.

**Monitoring**. Regular joint meetings should be held and the progress of OKRs
monitored. Monitoring can quickly identify a range of problems that need to be
corrected. It is also worth paying attention to feedback, both positive and
negative, to help colleagues better understand their strengths and weaknesses
and make more accurate predictions about performance.

**Simplicity.** Formulate goals and key metrics in a simple and straightforward
manner.

**Flexibility.** Unlike KPIs, OKRs imply greater flexibility in management. If
you realise that an objective or key result is no longer relevant or has been
formulated incorrectly, adjust it immediately. You don't have to wait for the
end of the reporting quarter or year, remove objectives and set new ones

## Step-by-step plan

1. **Staging**

Objectives come from the company's strategy, so the first step
in setting setting a strategy based on the organisation's vision and the results
of the situation analysis. One to three key objectives should then be
formulated.

2. **Agreement**

The process of harmonisation takes place both vertically - with management and
horizontally - between departments. The formulated goals should reach the staff,
and they should provide feedback and make adjustments if necessary. At least
half of them are formulated by employees themselves.

3. **Definition of key indicators**

Once the goal setting process has been completed at all levels, from top
management to individual teams, examples of Key Results should be identified.
Most often Key Results are measurable rather than abstract, but sometimes a key
indicator can be an individual project.

4. **Measurement and evaluation**

Check your quarterly goals every month and your annual goals quarterly. If you
haven't met the goal, it may be worth revisiting key results. The more often you
refer to ROCs, the better

5. **Corrections**

If you realise that a key result does not allow you to assess progress towards
the objective, it should be replaced. You can also remove an objective if you
realise that it is no longer a key objective, or if more important objectives
have emerged and the organisation's resources need to be reallocated.

## Who OKR is suitable for

OKR implies setting ambitious goals, but does not give an answer to the question
of how exactly to achieve them. This approach makes the team more flexible and
allows them to move from linear thinking and process optimisation to the
creation of new ones. In addition, OKR differs from other technologies, such as
KPI and SMART, in that it sets itself the task of not only defining missions,
but also developing strategies and tactics for achieving them. This approach
allows you not only to set ambitious aspirations, but also to consciously
approach their fulfilment, taking into account the available capabilities and
resources of the company.

OKR methodology is useful:

**Large Businesses**. In large organisations it is quite difficult to keep in
touch with employees and maintain focus on key tasks. ROC allows you to show how
staff and their actions affect the company's results and keep them motivated.
The methodology helps to create a friendlier atmosphere in the team and
encourages colleagues to co-operate and communicate.

**Mid-sized businesses.** A sustainable business in a mature stage that has
found an effective business model can stay in the same place for many years. ROC
allows you to find new ways to grow;

**Startups.** Help you focus on the most important tasks that will help the
business grow and properly manage limited resources.

**Executives**. OKRs can be a good tool for new leaders who have little
experience and are not yet "in the know". It can help you understand whether
your team is moving in the right direction and what support they need.

It is important to emphasise that OKR methodology is not suitable for line
managers, operational workers and routine tasks - in such cases it is better to
use a KPI system. However, if you are the OKR leader of a team or department,
implementing OKRs can significantly improve performance. Keep in mind that OKR
is a way of goal-setting that aims to achieve better results, not a panacea for
all company problems. If you need to optimise your workflows, a better solution
is to implement a CRM system or learn Agile principles.

## When working with OKRs, remember

1. Your goal should be a super goal. Don't try to immediately think about how
   and in what way to achieve it.

2. For each goal, you need to identify its measurable key indicators.

3. Constantly check in with your goals and monitor their progress. Without
   control, the OKR system can be detrimental to the business.

4. A well formulated goal does not have to be met 100% of the time. Achieving
   60-75% of key indicators is already considered a success.

5. Lack of result is also a result. Not achieving a goal is quite normal. The
   main thing is that you have to keep moving in this direction;
