In order to make a company profitable, successful and viable, it is important to
manage all its departments competently. This function is performed by the
organization's management system. It includes tools, technologies and methods of
influencing resources to obtain the planned result. Management of an enterprise
means directing it to the set goal by maximizing the opportunities from the
existing resources at its disposal.

## Functions and elements of the management system

The management system of an organization is used to develop, make managerial
decisions, communicate them to executors and control their execution. Its
functions include:

- development of the company's mission;

- distribution of management and production functions;

- Setting up procedures for employee interaction;

- rational allocation of resources;

- organization of interaction with the external environment;

- implementation of measures aimed at modernizing the company;

- innovation activities;

- company development.

This complexly constructed entity consists of the following elements:

- bodies or management entities (posts or management units);

- communications that ensure the implementation of management decisions;

- a set of methods, tools and technologies regulating employee behavior
  patterns;

- legal support for governance (in the form of norms, established rules and
  authorities);

- management process (consisting of communications and management decisions);

- specifications.

Management distinguishes five groups of processes that cover the work of any
enterprise. They are the objects of the company's management. They include:

- Production;

- Marketing;

- Finance;

- Human Resources;

- Accounting and analysis of the company's business activities.

The organizational structure of management is formed by management bodies. They
are united with each other by communication channels. Methods, technologies,
tools and procedures that determine the ways of influencing the performers form
the management mechanism. The management system is considered organized when its
boundaries, composition of elements, structure, interaction scheme and functions
of each element are defined.

## Principles of functioning of the management system

![management system](/processy-upravleniya-proektami-1024x342.webp)

The management system is based on adherence to the following principles:

- **Division and specialization of labor**. Employees are given tasks that
  correspond to their qualifications, experience and knowledge.

- **Harmonious combination of centralization and decentralization in
  management**. There are no "pure" structures. Application of a centralized
  approach with clear subordination to one management center ensures effective
  coordination of all structural units of the company. Transfer of some powers
  and responsibilities to lower levels makes management flexible and adaptive to
  external conditions.

- **Scientific and theoretical confirmation**. Assumes the use of special
  techniques and technologies to preserve the company's sustainability when
  introducing socio-economic reforms.

- **Planning**. Aimed at developing major and supporting actions to support the
  organization's activities.

- **Stable staff composition**. Compliance with this principle helps to reduce
  the cost of hiring, training, adaptation of new employees, and maintain
  productivity at a constant level.

- **Stimulation and motivation of personnel**. Selection of competent methods of
  stimulating employees will positively affect the quality of their work,
  improve their performance, contributing to increased profits.

- **Development of each employee and the company as a whole**. This principle is
  realized through seminars, trainings inside and outside the company.
  Qualified, educated employees have better efficiency, opening new development
  prospects for the organization.

- **Democratization**. Striving for mutual well-being. Employees should be
  interested in increasing the profitability of the company, as this will lead
  to an increase in their wages and living standards.

Responsibility for the implementation of the management principles in the system
is assigned to the company managers.

## Structure of the organizational management system

![organizational management system](/planirovanie-raboty-menedzhera-1024x372.webp)

The management system of an organization consists of managing and managed
subsystems. The managing part includes the directorate, managers, information
elements and services that support the work of management. Otherwise it is
called administrative and management apparatus. Its functions include making
managerial decisions based on the information received. The managed part
includes units involved in the production process and creation of the final
product.

The management system goes through the following stages:

- formation of the general structural scheme of the management apparatus;

- Developing the composition of management departments and organizing the links
  between them;

- refining and organizing an effective management structure.

When building the management system of an organization, horizontal and vertical
links are formed. Horizontal links are established between departments at the
same level of management. That is, they are not subordinate to each other.
Vertical ones imply subordination of a lower element to a higher one.

Organizational structures are divided into groups:

- with vertical (hierarchical) type of management;

- with horizontal or organic type of control.

### Peculiarities of vertical organizational structure

The following conditions must be met for the successful functioning of a company
under the vertical (hierarchical) type of management:

- strict subordination of the lower links of the structure to the higher ones;

- competent distribution of responsibilities among employees;

- the prevalence of vertical ties;

- hiring highly skilled workers.

The vertical management structure is based on the pyramid principle. The bottom
of the pyramid consists of the lowest positions. The higher the position, the
more powers and opportunities its holder has.

Companies with a hierarchical structure are managed by general directors, who
are subordinated to their deputies in priority areas. They are followed by
middle managers, lower managers and then executives. In organizations with this
type of management there are often problems with the execution of assignments
because of the long path of information from higher to lower levels. As a
result, executives often receive distorted or incomplete information from
management.

### Advantages of horizontal management structure

This type of management is characterized by flexibility and adaptability to
changing external conditions. It implies the rejection of hierarchy with the
construction of horizontal links between the participants of the work process.
By eliminating bureaucracy in the company's management structure, the path of
orders from the manager to the executors is significantly reduced. This allows
to reduce the period of coordination and approval of documents, to fulfill the
set tasks promptly and qualitatively.

For the effective existence of such a structure it is important to attract
initiative and creative performers. They should interact with each other at a
high level. Sometimes it is quite problematic to achieve this, especially if the
participants of the structure have opposite views on problem solving.

The more diverse the company's activities, the more complex the organizational
structure of management it has. Based on its type, appropriate management
methods are applied.

## Methods of organization management

![Methods of organization management](/tipy-upravleniya-komandoi-proekta-1024x384.webp)

According to the nature of the impact on objects, management methods are:

- Organizational and administrative (direct or indirect). Direct methods of
  management are expressed in the form of prescriptions indicating to the
  employee the sequence of work performance. Indirect methods are realized in
  the form of goals and motivation of employees.

- Economic. These include:
    - direct economic calculation performed by the highest levels of government;
    - economic or commercial calculation that ensures the profitability of the
      organization;
    - planning, economic and normative indicators and ways to achieve them;
    - analysis of business activities, which involves calculating possible risks
      and considering possible options for the company's development;
    - pricing appropriate to the market situation;
    - financing, crediting, aimed at determining the sources of enterprise
      development;
    - economic incentives that take into account the interests of the staff.
    - Separately consider economic and mathematical methods, including game
      theory, mathematical programming and other ways of managing the company's
      activities.

- Social and psychological. This is a set of tools affecting relations within
  the team. These management methods are aimed at maintaining a "healthy"
  microclimate in the team, creating comfortable working conditions for each
  employee. They include:
    - social development;
    - conviction;
    - criticism and self-criticism;
    - meetings;
    - competition within the team;
    - corporate customs.

- Self-management. It is characterized by freedom of choice in decision-making
  and their mandatory execution by all participants in the work process. Issues
  related to the company's business activities are resolved at joint meetings.

According to the degree of involvement in the process, management methods are
systemic and manual. In systemic processes, direct managerial influence is
minimized. Their participants are guided in their work by established rules.
They do not need additional instructions or other means of stimulation. The
rules are established by laws, regulations or standards developed in the
company. Manual management is characterized by the direct participation of the
manager in coordinating the actions of subordinates. Without his instructions,
performers can not perform any work. This method of management is considered
ineffective, since it completely deprives employees of initiative and
responsibility for their actions. Therefore, it is resorted to in exceptional
cases.

The choice of management methods determines the type of functioning and behavior
of workers. It can be:

- Forced. It is characterized by the performance of duties under constant
  "pressure" from above. It is accompanied by the formation of a sense of
  dependence and dislike of management.

- Passive. When employees do not show initiative, acting solely on orders from
  top management.

- Informed. When all team members participate in setting and solving problems.

## Models of control systems

Based on the principles and specifics of the company's activities, models of
organization management are developed. Currently, two models are used in
practical conditions:

- Goal management;

- Change management.

Goal management implies organizing the company's activities by setting
intermediate goals. This model is used in organizations that do not have a clear
statement of ultimate objectives. Therefore, they have to move from one stage to
another, which can cause periodic fluctuations from one line of business to
another. This model indicates ineffective operation of the company's management
system.

Change management implies that there is one constant goal, on the way to the
realization of which intermediate tasks are performed. In this case, all
objectives remain unchanged. Only the standards and technologies of management
processes are improved.

## Effectiveness of LeaderTask application in organization management

To improve the quality of organization of management processes, special
electronic applications are used, such as LeaderTask. This is a modern,
functional software product designed to solve any issues related to the
organization and increase the efficiency of company management.

The following useful features are present in the LeaderTask app:

The program works on all digital platforms. It has all the capabilities to
organize company management in the office and remotely. Suitable for individual
and team use.

## Conclusion

The effectiveness of the company's management system is evidenced by the balance
of centralization and decentralization of power, the ability to adapt to
external conditions. The work of such enterprises is not focused on personal
needs, but on the needs and interests of the consumer.

Various methods are used to optimize control systems. Examples from practice
prove that the best effect in management is achieved by applying an integrated
approach together with automation of control processes.

One way to improve the efficiency of company management is to use a theory of
constraints approach that does not require a one-time modernization of the
system. To do this, one concentrates on individual areas of work. At each of
them there is a "weak point" that hinders the fulfillment of tasks. Determine
ways to eliminate it. They get rid of it. After solving the identified problem,
they find the next "limiter" that hinders the normal development of the company.
Thus, they gradually improve the system without resorting to drastic measures.
