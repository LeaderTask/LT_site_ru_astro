## What are the benefits of online planning?

Online planning has several clear advantages over its offline counterpart:

1. Possibility to change its to-do list in 2 clicks;

2. The absence of dirt in the daily is an essential aspect of planning
   psychology;

3. The possibility to create a single to-do list on all their devices;

4. Create to-do lists for any day, week, month and year ahead, etc.

But online planning may also have some shortcomings. Thus, for example, not all
online daily books allow to work with tasks in offline mode. And it is very
important - after all if you go somewhere on a business trip, work on the plane
literally stops.

There is one scheduler that allows you to work in online and offline modes. It's
LeaderTask.
