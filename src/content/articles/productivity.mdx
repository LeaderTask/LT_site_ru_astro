In order to make a work plan and distribute tasks between employees, it is
important to know how well and quickly the team is working. Proper planning
always starts with analyzing the current situation, and to make it easier for
you to evaluate the team's efficiency, LeaderTask has the Productivity plugin.

To assess productivity, the system only tracks assigned tasks. Productivity
takes into account how many tasks were completed on time and how many tasks were
assigned in total.

##### Price: 44 $.

Once purchased, the Productivity plugin will be available to all license users,
both current and future.

**Note**: The plug-in works only in the Web-version of LeaderTask. Web-plugin is
purchased separately from the license once and for all.
