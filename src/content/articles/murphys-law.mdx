Any person who learns the essence of Murphy's Law will say: "yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, we've seen it, we know it, it's right about me". Briefly, it says that if
trouble can happen, it will happen. In life, such failures happen to us all the
time - you stand at the end of the shortest line, the next one immediately began
to move faster; you throw away an unnecessary thing, and it soon became
necessary; you are late for work, there are bound to be traffic jams on the
roads, and transport will stand at every traffic light.

The ironic philosophical concept existed long before the name originated. But is
there more to it than that? Let's get to the bottom of it.

## History of origin

In the middle of the last century there lived an uncle named Murphy, not the
actor Eddie, but Major Edward, but also from the USA. He noticed that
"shit-happens" were encountered by everyone in general, and simply summarized
the observations.

In 1949, a team of engineers, along with Murphy, studied engine problems at an
American airbase. The purpose of the study was to find the most possible causes
of Air Force aircraft crashes.

On examining one of the mechanisms, it turned out that the engine screws were
spinning in the opposite direction due to a mechanical error. When the problem
was found, Major Murphy said: "If you can do something two ways, one of which is
wrong, a man will choose that one." The statement resonated with his colleagues
and later traveled beyond the military base and was liked by the rest of the
nation.

There was even a benefit: later colleagues, referring to Murphy, were more
attentive to the tasks in the research. This saved other problems and improved
the quality of work. For many people, this kind of law removes responsibility
from the participants of the situation and shifts it to external factors.
Anything is better than calling yourself a person with hands growing out of the
wrong place.

## How Murphy's Law works

The law has no scientific proof. All mistakes made by people are explained by
the simple human factor. Their probability increases due to multivariate
actions, lack of sufficient experience or knowledge, working under stress.

What does the law mean in terms of how the human psyche works? Selective memory
emphasizes only the moments that elicited the most vivid response. Of the many
neutral and positive outcomes of any situation, the brain will remember only
one - the negative one.

Belief in Murphy's Law is the result of brain weirdness. For example, if you
clean a window in an apartment every month in good weather, a person will not
remember the simple action. But if it rains once after cleaning, the brain will
associate clean windows and bad weather. A housewife will formulate this way: "I
washed the windows - to be rain". A variant for drivers: "Washed the car - it
will rain".

A scientist once tried to prove this law (yes, yes, of course, a British one) by
comparing the meaning with the thermodynamic law. But proving the assumption
with the help of probability theory did not work. The situation can develop in
any direction, and conditions can change.

## How to apply Murphy's Law

You cannot take the law as a hundred percent probability of a negative outcome
of any situation. For example, every day millions of people buy goods in online
stores, but only the lucky ones can get to a phishing site or transfer money to
fraudsters. Random? Not really. Any inattentive person can fall into the trap of
ill-wishers. But if you treat your finances with more responsibility and check
all transactions, the probability of falling into the net of fraudsters is
minimal.

Murphy's Law causes us to view any situation as potentially dangerous. It causes
us to leave the house early to avoid being late for an important meeting, to
check that appliances in the house are turned off, to keep personal belongings
under supervision.

Everyday life, when Murphy's Law intrudes, usually turns into situations that
are irritating. But they are rarely accompanied by critical consequences.

Murphy's Law is not to be dwelt upon. If you approach it rationally, you can
avoid many troubles. For example, you can calmly accept the negative course of
events and have a few backup plans in case the law of the humorous American
major will work. Or you can become paranoid and destroy your psyche with
constant anxiety without having a plan "B".

There is also a working exercise that allows you to calm down quickly. Ask
yourself questions that the worst thing that can happen in different spheres of
life: professional, personal, family, household, social and others. After that,
come up with a plan of action in case a complete failure occurs. Here, there is
a strategy, you have even already partially lived the worst.

## Murphy's Law in business

The bigger the deal, the larger the sums at stake. It is not surprising that
entrepreneurs are nervous and anxious before transactions. You can't completely
prevent negativity, but you can reduce the likelihood of some of the problems if
you prepare in advance, calculate the risks and correct the plan. For example,
before an important transaction, you can be nervous and spill coffee on
yourself. But a prudent person has a spare shirt at work. And pants. Just in
case.

Large businesses (if they don't close immediately) have strategies for any force
majeure. Managers know what to do if the power goes out or a key employee quits:
data backups are set up on computers, and a few lower-level employees can
temporarily replace a boss who has jumped ship. In business, it is important to
understand possible risks, plan a backup algorithm of actions, train employees
to make more modern decisions, and develop standards for the work of
organizations. In general, spread straws wherever you can fall.

However, it is not possible to fully control the work process. Employees have
different experience, education, emotional state and level of current fatigue.
Even if an employee has been doing the same thing for many years, this does not
guarantee a hundred percent perfect result.

## What's the bottom line

Murphy effect - can be a useful chip for a lighter attitude to life situations.
It can save you from unnecessary mistakes, contribute to increased
attentiveness, careful control of work and daily affairs.

Thanks to the law, we realize that everyone can make absurd mistakes and life
can throw all sorts of things at us. But by choosing an appropriate behavioral
pattern and thinking through a strategy of action, we make the day more
comfortable and predictable without relying on chance.

basics.
