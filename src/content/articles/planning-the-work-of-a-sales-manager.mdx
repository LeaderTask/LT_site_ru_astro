The rapid pace of life and limited timeframes for activities often put even the
most responsible managers in a deadlock. Therefore, an important skill for any
manager is the ability to plan the working day and prioritize tasks correctly.

But how can this be achieved in modern conditions? Let us consider this question
in more detail below in the article.

## Why schedule the work

A manager is a key figure in the work of any company, the success, sales and
profits of the business directly depend on the effectiveness of his activity.
Most managers in enterprises perform a huge number of different functions.

They manage the activities of the organization, coordinate the activities of
subdivisions, departments and services, work with human resource units,
determine the goals and objectives of the activities of other employees. In
addition, they are responsible for decision-making, control the fulfillment of
projects of executors, represent the company at meetings with customers and
partners.

Such multitasking requires high professional and personal qualities from a
manager. He should not only have theoretical knowledge of his specialty, but
also be able to react quickly to changes, be stress-resistant and effectively
plan his working day literally in a couple of minutes or steps.

However, recently more and more managers are characterized by a complete
inability to manage their time. This is due to the huge number of things
managers have to do (operational meetings, planning meetings, appointments,
business calls), as well as many distractions.

This raises issues for the manager such as:

- weak elaboration of key areas of activity;

- haphazard use of documentation, correspondence;

- confusion, constant rushing, nervousness;

- insufficient level of managerial labor, low degree of delegation, lack of
  responsibility of subordinates;

- no order in the workplace, no clarity in business, no organization;

- The need to stay late at work or finish work at home.

It is important to remember that time is the only resource that cannot be
renewed. Therefore, time management and the ability to build a proper daily
schedule are the most important target skills that allow a manager to use the
day in a calculated and rational way, to achieve success in the company's
development, to minimize costs and to be self-confident.

And an increasing number of managers are thinking about how to level the effect
of time leakage from under their fingers and manage working hours as
productively as possible, in order to have time to do the maximum number of
tasks, get the appropriate income and move further up the career ladder.

## Principles of manager's work planning

In order to properly allocate time during the workday, each employee must adhere
to certain principles of self-management. Let's consider examples of the main
ones:

1. Plan ahead (for the day, week, month). Make clear short- and long-term plans,
   label them on paper or electronically. Break down large tasks into subtasks.
   Allow time for force majeure.

2. Formulate specific goals, moving from the general to the particular. Develop
   a system of values, taking into account possible mistakes. Think about
   consequences, motivation of personnel.

3. Fix or visualize plans in special programs. Always make backups, store data
   in cloud storage.

4. Prioritize. Rank things in order of importance, do the important and urgent
   things first, only then move on to the minor ones. Plan and execute
   difficult, unpleasant tasks during hours of personal peak productivity.

5. Focus on what's important. Concentrate on large-scale goals, do not get
   distracted by extraneous things, know how to say "no", avoid unscheduled
   breaks, idle chatter, watching social networks, TV during working hours.

6. Analyze the experience. Remain aware, observe changes, review past mistakes.
   Draw conclusions from the analysis. Find a way out of difficult situations
   and take measures in advance to prevent them from happening again.

7. Plan for rest. Improve personal performance by restoring resources during
   socializing with loved ones, meals, and sleep.

The ability to follow all of the above principles and features distinguishes an
effective manager from an unproductive one who wastes time for nothing. However,
in order to build such a systematic approach, it is necessary to make
considerable efforts, develop self-organization skills, and constantly be in the
tone, which not every manager can do.

## Planning methods

Let's look at a few popular time-management techniques that allow managers from
any area of business to effectively manage working time, become more productive
and increase firm values, labor rates.

### 1. SMART approach

A unique method for describing and setting specific goals according to clear
principles. It was first described by George Doran in 1981. It is very popular
among people interested in personal and professional productivity. It gets its
name due to the basic principles underlying the technology

- S (Specific) - Specificity: the objectives should be stated unambiguously,
  with no liberties taken;

- M (Measurable) - measurability: to understand how and with what criteria the
  process of achieving a goal can be measured;

- A (Achievable) - achievable: set realistic targets, without exaggerated
  expectations;

- R (Relevanr) - Relevance: choose relevant and timely goals that the company
  needs at the moment;

- T (Time bond) - Time constraint: specify a clear deadline.

**Who is suitable for**: managers working in project management, management,
advertising, production. But will not be very useful to people with a creative
mind, as well as creative positions, professions.

### 2. Pareto Principle

A theory put forward in the early 20th century by economist and sociologist
Vilfredo Pareto. It is a reflection of the dependence of results on the effort
put into them. Pareto's rule states that only 20% of efforts give 80% of the
result, while the other 80% of efforts bring only 20% of the final result.

According to this proportion, the technique suggests that time should be
allocated first and foremost to the priority activities that produce a higher
percentage of results but take the least amount of time. The theory helps to
identify the right goals and prioritize them correctly.

**Who's Suitable**: managers in any field of business for professional and
personal achievement.

### 3\. Parkinson's Law

There are several laws in total, formulated by historian Cyril Northcote
Parkinson. But the most famous of them is the first one, which states that "Work
takes the time given to it". The principle states that the performance of any
activity takes exactly as much time as is spent on it.

As such, employees are encouraged to track the amount of time spent on a
particular task over several days and then use the data to effectively plan
their workday.

**Who is suitable for**: managers of any field of business.

### 4. Eisenhower Matrix

A special system created by the methodology of the 34th President of the United
States, Dwight Eisenhower, and later popularized by the American writer Stephen
Covey. It consists in categorizing all cases into four groups:

1. Important and urgent.

2. Important and non-urgent.

3. The unimportant and the urgent.

4. The unimportant and the non-urgent.

Tasks from the first group are suggested to be performed first, while tasks from
group 3 should be delegated and those from group 4 should be canceled or
replaced.

**Who is suitable for**: managers who find it difficult to plan their working
hours.

### 5\. ABVHD method

A popular modern method proposed by business coach Brian Tracy. It consists of
simply ranking things according to their importance and quickly achieving
results. It suggests making a list of tasks and then categorizing them by
importance in alphabetical order. A letter A is assigned to the main goal, B to
the less important goal, and so on.

**Who is suitable for whom**: managers of any sphere of business, who have to
solve a huge number of tasks on a daily basis.

## Mistakes in planning

Time management does not forgive managers for even small mistakes made even for
good reasons. Therefore, it is better to know the enemy in advance in order to
understand where and in what place a manager can make a mistake or misstep. The
main mistakes in planning and conducting a working day are:

- the inability to say no, to say no;

- the desire to be good, helpful, and try to do everyone a favor;

- slowness and absent-mindedness in general;

- inability or unwillingness to listen to the interlocutor;

- excessive sociability;

- Inability to estimate the amount of work to be done, to set a deadline date;

- a complete avoidance of setting any deadlines;

- the habit of procrastination or grabbing everything at once;

- Lack of habit of taking notes, fixing plans and tasks.

You need to make as few of these mistakes as possible to be effective at work,
get your daily chores done, and have a productive day.

Also the main enemies of managers are called two character traits that prevent
them from performing tasks in a timely manner and organizing the day correctly.
They include procrastination (constant desire to put things off for later, to
choose in favor of unnecessary and unimportant tasks) and perfectionism (eternal
dissatisfaction with the result, the desire to redo, to bring things to an
unattainable ideal).

## Scheduling app

time and work planning are often of undoubted benefit to the employees of an
enterprise. They are called task trackers and are successfully used in both
large and small companies.
