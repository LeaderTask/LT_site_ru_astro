The concept of "hard skills" began to be used in the military in the 1960s. This
term described the abilities required to work with mechanized devices. A little
later, the concept began to be used in business and psychology.

Hard skills or "hard, hard skills" are skills, knowledge, skills in some
professional field. They can be acquired over a period of time. And they are
required to perform specific tasks on the job. It can be proficiency in
programming languages, knowledge of HTML and CSS for developers, or English at a
high level of Advanced (C1) for translators, and for engineers the basic skills
will be the ability to work with various devices or mechanisms. That is, the
component that will remain the same when moving to a new position or job.

We acquire solid skills in a scientific and educational environment, in the
process of studying at higher, specialized secondary educational institutions,
in online courses or various internships. Some skills are mastered
independently, others are adopted from more experienced teachers, educators,
specialists. They are different for each area of professional activity.

Mastering professional skills requires mental effort. When mastering them, the
left hemisphere of the brain is engaged, memory, attention and logical thinking
are developed. Hard skills can be clearly demonstrated, assessed, measured. They
are acquired and honed gradually, becoming more complex from level to level.

## How hard skills differ from soft skills

![How hard skills differ from soft skills](/business-soft.webp)

Hard skills are qualities, abilities, skills required in a particular
profession. And soft skills are skills related to a person's personal
characteristics: communication skills, customer orientation and so on.

The development of hard and soft skills is equally important in any profession,
because they are personal qualities. However, for some activities, hard skills
are more essential. For example, a pilot must first and foremost be able to fly
an airplane, but the ability to communicate with other people is not of primary
importance. For a person in a managerial position, for example, hard skills and
soft skills are equally important.

Based on the ratio of soft to hard skills, all occupations can be roughly
divided into three categories:

- With dominant hard skills. These are related to technology or scientific
  endeavors. For example, nuclear physicist, bioengineer, chemist. These
  specialties are valuable for their professional knowledge, so such specialists
  are primarily evaluated by these criteria. Their sociability, ability to work
  in a team is of little importance.

- With equal hardskills and softskills. This category includes accountants,
  financial officers, lawyers, and investigators. They need to be professionally
  savvy, but also interact successfully with others.

- With prevailing soft skills. They are necessary for politics, business, sales,
  tourism. Charisma, the ability to persuade and communicate with the audience
  are much more important to specialists working in these fields than knowledge
  of technical issues.

The differences between them are summarized in the following table:

| Hard skills                             | Soft skiils                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Relate to a particular profession       | Needed in all areas of work and life                                |
| Requires thinking effort, concentration | Related to emotional intelligence                                   |
| Tested by tests, exams                  | Possible errors in testing                                          |
| Confirmed by documents                  | Demonstrated in the work                                            |
| Can be mastered in a short time         | A long, emotionally taxing process that requires patience           |
| Improve with experience                 | Developed in specific situations                                    |
| Identical for one professional area     | They need to be rearranged depending on the environment they are in |
| Base or foundation for future work      | The foundation of learning anything new, including hard skills.     |
