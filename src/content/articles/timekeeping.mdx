If a team fails to meet a deadline, you need to look for reasons and take
action. A fairly simple and effective way of doing this is timekeeping. This is
a timekeeping procedure that allows you to visually compare planned time with
actual time spent.

Timekeeping helps to identify bottlenecks in the team's time management and
reduce time spent on repetitive tasks. Initially, this method was used in flow
production. But due to its high flexibility and adaptability, timekeeping is
successfully applied in a wide range of areas.

To begin with, let's look at the classic approach: how a day's timekeeping is
carried out in production. On the initiative of the company's management, the
speed at which workers perform typical operations is measured. In-house or
invited standardizers make observations and record the results. The management
draws conclusions based on the data obtained: whether to raise production
standards or leave them as they are.

But timekeeping is not only used to re-evaluate standards. In addition to
measuring time, timekeepers also take photos of an employee's workplace and
videotape the entire work process. By comparing the technique of performing the
same operations by different employees, it is possible to identify both
efficient and inefficient practices. Irrational and unnecessary labor practices
are eliminated, while the most successful ones are replicated throughout the
entire production.

## How to work on the timing system

Keeping timekeeping of the day is a responsible element of management activity.
To properly analyze the speed of your employees' work, you need to follow a
certain sequence of actions. We have compiled a step-by-step roadmap that will
definitely help you analyze the duration of tasks.

### Setting timekeeping objectives

Before starting the procedure, it is important to clearly define the objectives
of the process and the target group of employees. The objectives can range from
performance evaluation to workflow optimization. Determine which activity you
want to improve and which employees will be involved in the process.

### Choice of tools and approach

Choose an approach and tools for conducting timekeeping. The choice of approach
depends on the specifics of your organization, the resources available, and the
purpose of the observations. This may include:

- **Use of specialized software**. There are many programs and applications
  designed specifically for timekeeping. They allow employees to easily record
  time, and managers to track and analyze the data.

- **Manual timekeeping**. If you don't have access to specialized tools,
  employees can keep time logs manually. It's important to make sure these
  records are accurate and updated regularly.

- **Automated timekeeping**. Some systems can automatically record work time
  based on an employee's computer activity. This can be useful for determining
  the time spent on specific tasks.

### Employee training

Explain to employees how to use the selected tools correctly and how this will
improve productivity and efficiency. Training should emphasize that timekeeping
is not a means of control, but a tool for self-improvement and more efficient
work.

### Establishment of a categorization system

Develop a categorization system for the tasks and activities that will be
tracked. This will help you organize your data and more accurately analyze
exactly what your time is spent on. Categories can include projects, clients,
task types, and other parameters that are important to your organization.

### Data collection

Start collecting data on the time employees spend on tasks. Depending on the
chosen approach, this may be:

- Making entries into specialized software.

- Filling in timesheets or time logs.

- Automatically collect data using activity monitoring tools.

Ensure that staff regularly and accurately enter data to ensure accurate and
reliable results.

### Creating a results table

A simple spreadsheet will help you quickly analyze employee performance and
implement conclusions. Create an electronic document with a matrix that shows
the results of observations and set norms. The table allows you to visualize the
data and easily manage the norms of task performance. This contributes to better
time management in the organization. In our example, we have made the following
columns:

- Task title.

- Employee or team names.

- Average time to complete a task for each worker.

- The normative time to complete a task.

- Additional parameters or comments if needed.

### Analyzing the results

Use metering results to evaluate employee performance and optimize work
processes. Compare actual time spent on tasks to expected time based on
experience or standards. Identify areas where improvements in productivity and
efficiency are possible. If the standard is exceeded, analyze the reasons and
propose solutions to the problem.

### Taking action

Based on the results of the analysis, take the necessary actions to improve
performance and efficiency. These could be the following actions:

- Workflow optimization.

- Reallocation of tasks and resources.

- Providing training and coaching to employees.

- Making changes to work schedules or priorities.

### Monitoring and refinement

Timekeeping is a long-term process that requires constant monitoring and
refinement. Continue to track time and analyze data to see if changes lead to
improvements. Regularly update your categorization system, train new employees,
and adapt to changing conditions.

## **Optimization of timekeeping of working time**

To maximize the effectiveness of timekeeping, the following aspects should be
considered:

1. **Use of specialized software**. There are many tools and applications that
   simplify the timekeeping process. They allow you to automate data collection
   and create reports.

2. **Employee training**. It is important to train employees on the proper use
   of timekeeping and explain to them the benefits it brings to both them and
   the company.

3. **Eliminating micromanagement**. Timekeeping should be a management tool, not
   a means of micromanagement. Employees should also be given sufficient freedom
   and autonomy.

## Application of timekeeping in various industries

Timekeeping is a powerful tool that has been successfully applied in various
industries. Its flexibility and versatility allow this tool to be adapted to the
specific tasks and peculiarities of each field.

### Business and Management

In business and management, timekeeping is used to evaluate the performance of
employees and teams. It reveals which tasks take the most time, which can be
useful for resource planning and optimizing workflows. It is important to
emphasize that timekeeping not only evaluates but also improves performance by
helping managers allocate tasks and resources more accurately.

### Production

In the industrial sector, timekeeping helps to optimize work processes at every
single stage of production. It identifies bottlenecks where time is spent
inefficiently and helps improve productivity. Companies can use timekeeping to
determine the time spent on each unit of production, which is important for
quality control and meeting deadlines.

### Information technology

In IT, timekeeping helps to track the time spent on software development,
testing and maintenance. It allows you to determine at which stages of projects
the most time and resources are spent. IT companies can use timekeeping for more
accurate customer billing and project management.

All these features of timekeeping application emphasize its importance as a tool
to improve productivity, efficiency and quality of work in different industries
and activities. It allows to analyze and optimize time resources, contributing
to the achievement of higher results and level of competitiveness.

## Electronic timing on all devices
