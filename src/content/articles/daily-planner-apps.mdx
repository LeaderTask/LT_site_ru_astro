To remain efficient in your personal and professional life, you should install a
planner app. Most likely, you already have a default calendar app on your cell
phone. It can act as the most basic version of a digital diary. It lets you plan
tasks and set reminders, which is good when you don't have too much to do and
don't need to coordinate your activities with a team. If you have to juggle
multiple assignments and act as a part of a collective, it's essential to get a
more advanced organizer. It's a full-fledged business solution that will boost
your productivity.

A dedicated planner app enables you to:

- Schedule your plans for days, weeks, and months ahead

- Set up alarms for the most important events

- Group tasks into lists

- Split tasks into subtasks and add checklists to them

- Attach files of different formats to tasks

- Set priorities

- Track your progress in a visually comprehensive way

- Share selected elements of your timetable with third parties

- Flexibly customize the looks and functionality of the app

These were just a few examples of what a planner can do. The functionality of
many apps goes beyond this list, some have unique custom features.

The prices of such apps are usually affordable. Many have free personal plans to
get started, with limited functionality. For businesses, planners typically
charge a monthly or annual fee. This investment should quickly pay off. If you
use such apps systematically, you should be able to increase your income and
life satisfaction.

In this article, we'll list the best-performing and the most user-friendly daily
planner apps. Some offer only the basic functionality, while others are rich in
features. When comparing them, please pay attention to the platforms that
they're compatible with. Hopefully, you'll manage to find the one that best
suits your tastes, habits, and budget!

## 1\. LeaderTask

![LeaderTask app](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS, Android, web, desktop

📙 **User interface**: 5

🛠 **Features**: 5

🐴 **Performance**: 5

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

From our viewpoint, it's the best daily planner app. It's powerful and
versatile. Its target audience is very extensive and includes managers,
freelancers, students, entrepreneurs and all types of busy and ambitious people.
It's equally suitable for planning your individual routine or the activities of
a team.

With [LeaderTask](/downloads), you can create tasks, split them into an
unlimited number of subtasks and delegate them. You can make checklists for each
task and flexibly customize your task settings. It's enough to make one click to
forward a task from your email inbox to the planner. To remind you about the
tasks, the app will send you elegant-looking pop-up windows or push
notifications. The app marks completed tasks so that you can review the amount
of work done.

There is an in-built chat in the app where you can discuss the current progress
with your colleagues. LeaderTask allows you to attach files of various types to
each task, including text documents, images and archives. Even when the task is
completed, you'll still be able to access these files.

You shouldn't be afraid of excess work overload. Some planner apps let you
color-code top-priority tasks. LeaderTask has a more advanced Focus feature: it
displays the Focus content in the center of the screen so that you don't get
distracted on less important details.

When working with a team, you can assign different roles to its members and
delegate tasks. Each staff member will be able to access tasks according to
their admission level. You can group as many tasks as you wish in a project with
a comprehensive structure. The sorting and filtering functionality deserves
special praise. You'll be highly unlikely to lose a single bit of information
thanks to the smart search option.

Sometimes, you might need to go offline because of a technical failure or
because you're traveling. In such circumstances, you'll still be able to work
with all task manager instruments. You can even send files and the app will send
them as soon as you go online.

To our mind, LeaderTask sets the bar high for all the other planner apps from
the same niche.

💵 **Price**: $2.18 per individual per month for full functionality and a free
plan to start with

## 2\. Any.do

![Any.do](/anydo.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS, Android, web, desktop

📙 **User interface**: 5

🛠 **Features**: 4.5

🐴 **Performance**: 4.5

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

The vital competitive edge of this app is its minimalist interface. It's so
intuitive that it will take you only a couple of minutes to figure out how
everything functions. It will be easy for you to manage your assignments on the
run. Feel free to color-code your top priorities, make notes and attach files to
tasks. You'll be able to select from regular, recurring and location-based
reminders. Any.do is not exclusively work-oriented. It's a great application to
run your family calendar too.

With Any.Do, you can effortlessly synchronize data across multiple devices.
However, it supports integrations only with selected business apps, which can be
a challenge for busy professionals.

💵 **Price**: $5.99 per individual per month for full functionality and a free
plan to start with

## 3\. Trello

![Trello](/Trello_Calendar.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS, Android, web, desktop

📙 **User interface**: 4.5

🛠 **Features**: 4.5

🐴 **Performance**: 5

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

The scheduling features of this one are amazing. It's a pleasure to create
tasks, work with time slots and cards, group assignments and set up deadlines.
Trello lets you create custom buttons, which is particularly important for
progress tracking. Business people appreciate its automation opportunities,
collaboration features and Kanban boards. Trello integrates with Dropbox, Slack
and other popular solutions.

The main weak point of this otherwise excellent app is search. Not everyone
manages to find what they're looking for from the first attempt. The more things
you have planned, the less resultive the search.

💵 **Price**: $10 per individual per month for full functionality and a free
plan to start with

## 4\. Todoist

![Todoist](/ToDoist-Planner.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS, Android, web

📙 **User interface**: 4.5

🛠 **Features**: 4.5

🐴 **Performance**: 5

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

As its name suggests, this app lets you create user-friendly, customizable and
visually appealing to-do lists. You can switch between various view formats and
share the contents of your app with others. Your colleagues will be able to
synchronize their emails, files and calendars with you. Todoist enables you to
label and color-code tasks to set priorities. You'll appreciate its deadlines
functionality and helpful reminders, which can be recurring. The app nicely
integrates with popular business solutions such as Dropbox.

If you purchase the full version, you might be fully satisfied with this app.
But if you stay with the free one, be ready to face limitations. They're related
to filtering tasks, creating subtasks and collaborating with others.

💵 **Price**: $3 per individual per month for full functionality and a free plan
to start with

## 5\. Google Calendar

![Google Calendar](/Googlecalendar.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS, Android, desktop, web

📙 **User interface**: 4

🛠 **Features**: 4.5

🐴 **Performance**: 4

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

You might have come across it if you have ever used any Google products. At a
glance, you can notice that the interface leaves a bit to be desired. It's not
too intuitive and it lacks flexible customization opportunities. You might
struggle with this appointment manager if you always have a lot of things to do.

The best thing about this scheduler is its seamless integration and
synchronization with all the other elements of the Google ecosystem. From one
app, you can access several calendars. The task search functionality is very
decent – and the same can be said about due dates for events and reminders.

💵 **Price**: $5 per individual per month for full functionality and a free plan
to start with

## 6\. Notion

![Notion](/notion-1024x621.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS, Android, web

📙 **User interface**: 4.5

🛠 **Features**: 5

🐴 **Performance**: 4.5

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.6

Notion is famous for its cross-functional collaboration opportunities. If you're
a manager or a business owner, you can create a comprehensive database of all
your staff members. The app facilitates the process of distributing tasks. It's
great for managing teams.

People who have been using Notion for a while keep praising it. But those who
have just installed it sometimes complain about the steep learning curve.
Besides, it's more comfortable to use this app on a personal computer or laptop
than on a mobile device. Plus, its automation abilities might be not as cool as
what its competitors offer.

💵 **Price**: at least $4 per individual per month for full functionality and a
free plan to start with

## 7\. Microsoft Outlook

![Microsoft Outlook](/outlookcalendarboard.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS, Android, desktop, web

📙 **User interface**: 4.5

🛠 **Features**: 4.5

🐴 **Performance**: 4.5

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.6

"Outlook in the list of the best daily planner apps? How is this possible?".
These questions are common among people who haven't used Microsoft products for
a while. This brand has considerably improved its offering and has become much
more competitive in the planner niche. Its interface looks sleek and its to-do
lists are very handy. It's a pleasure to create, group and filter tasks. No need
to say, this product is compatible with all the other MS Office apps and
solutions.

When it comes to integrations, Outlook is selective. You might fail to integrate
it with another mailbox — but you might succeed in pairing it with another
planner. The only way to find it out is by trial and error.

💵 **Price**: free if you use it as an individual, $6.99 per person per month if
you purchase it as a part of the Microsoft 365 plan

## 8\. ZenDay

![ZenDay](/zenday-app.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS, Android, desktop

📙 **User interface**: 5

🛠 **Features**: 4

🐴 **Performance**: 4.5

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.6

Users value this app for its stand-alone 3D display. Checking off your task
lists becomes an exciting experience. Feel free to review the tasks one by one
or explore the whole list for the day in one go. Over time, tasks will
automatically scroll up. You'll be able to synchronize multiple calendars and
assign a priority level for each task with color-coding.

There is probably only one reason to complain about ZenDay. It's impossible to
see several task lists at once.

💵 **Price**: free

## 9\. Habitica

![Habitica](/Habitica_APP.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS, Android, desktop

📙 **User interface**: 4.5

🛠 **Features**: 4

🐴 **Performance**: 4.5

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

This app doesn't limit itself to the functionality of a planner. It goes one
step further and assumes a noble mission of developing good habits in its users.
To achieve this goal, it has embedded gamification features. You choose a cute
avatar and it will keep evolving, reflecting your personal progress. If you
wish, you can purchase avatar upgrades after earning rewards for your successes.
The app lets you schedule not just tasks but habits – such as improving your
health. The to-do lists are gamified. Users get a chance to connect with each
other in a social media community to share their stories and motivate each
other.

All of this might sound fascinating and unique – but Habitica has a serious
shortcoming. It struggles to handle complex projects.

💵 **Price**: free

## 10\. TickTick

![TickTick](/ticktick-app.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS, Android, web

📙 **User interface**: 4

🛠 **Features**: 4

🐴 **Performance**: 4.5

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.75

This app is popular among students. Its calendar is rather simple. It should be
convenient for you to assess the scope of the existing tasks at a glance. After
you schedule your tasks, you can share your lists with friends and colleagues.
If you need to edit a task on the go, you can do without typing and use your
voice instead. The calendar view lets you switch between daily and weekly tasks.
The reminders have intuitive settings. As a cherry on top, there is the Pomodoro
feature. Pomodoro is one of the best-known and most efficient time management
techniques.

You might ask why the audience of TickTick is so young. The answer is poor
integration capabilities. Office and remote workers tend to integrate multiple
apps into one ecosystem. With TickTick, you'll struggle to do it.

💵 **Price**: $27.99 per individual per year for full functionality and a free
plan to start with

## 11\. nTask

![nTask](/ntask.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS, Android, desktop

📙 **User interface**: 4

🛠 **Features**: 4

🐴 **Performance**: 4

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

It's a firm favorite of people who regularly use Kanban boards and Gantt charts
at work. nTasks supports both these features, which is great for time and task
management. It has an in-built time tracker that can make you more productive at
work. You can rely on it when setting deadlines and assigning collaborative
tasks. Recurring lists and team checklists are amazing for organizing your
business activities.

Unfortunately, nTask doesn't allow you to attach photos and documents to your
lists. It significantly limits your collaboration opportunities.

💵 **Price**: $2.99 per individual per month for full functionality and a free
plan to start with

## 12\. My Daily Planner

![My Daily Planner](/my-daily-planner.webp)

📱 **Format**: Android, desktop

📙 **User interface**: 4

🛠 **Features**: 4

🐴 **Performance**: 4.5

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.6

This planner has all the basic features of this type of app: a calendar,
reminders and to-do lists. For any task, you can set as many reminders as you
wish without paying extra. If you fail to complete a task, the app will
automatically remove it to the next day so that you don't forget about it. You
can group to-do lists and tasks in folders. The tracker remains available even
when you go offline. One of the best features is nested checklists. They're
perfect for setting goals and they will automatically measure your progress in
achieving these goals.

On the flip side, the functionality of the free version is limited. My Daily
Planner doesn't offer monthly or annual subscriptions. Instead, you'll need to
purchase each function separately. For some users, it can be a nuisance. Others
like it because it's a chance to save expenses – and it adds a gamification
element to time planning.

💵 **Price**: free – but be ready to make in-app purchases, each one with its
individual price

## 13\. Evernote

![Evernote](/evernote.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS, Android, web and desktop

📙 **User interface**: 5

🛠 **Features**: 5

🐴 **Performance**: 4

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

"Almost $8 for a daily planner app? Isn't it too much?". Some users find
Evernote's price prohibitive – and this is its key disadvantage.

The good thing is the app is powerful and versatile. It comes in equally handy
for students and working professionals. It supports multiple lists formatting,
so you can organize the information in the most convenient manner for you. If
you aren't satisfied with the ready-to-use collection, you'll be able to create
custom list templates. Evernote can work offline, so you can keep using it on a
plane. It integrates with many business apps, such as Outlook and Slack. Unlike
many competitors, this app lets you scribble handwritten notes and store them.

💵 **Price**: $7.99 per individual per month for full functionality and a free
plan to start with

## 14\. Fantastical 2

![Fantastical 2](/fantastic.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS

📙 **User interface**: 4

🛠 **Features**: 4

🐴 **Performance**: 4

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.6

It's a calendar app that also lets you manage tasks. For top-priority tasks, you
can set geofenced reminders. You can make recurring tasks and synchronize
multiple calendars. As nice add-ons, Fantastical 2 offers weather forecast and
conference call detection. Plus, it features natural language support.

💵 **Price**: free

## 15\. Planner Pro

![Planner Pro](/planner-pro.webp)

📱 **Format**: iOS

📙 **User interface**: 4

🛠 **Features**: 4

🐴 **Performance**: 4

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.4

This one has all the necessary functionality of a good planner – but hardly any
killer features. It enables you to create tasks, split them into subtasks and
make recurring tasks. The schedule is divided into daily, weekly, and monthly
modules. It will be easy for you to synchronize this app with your iPhone
calendar. It also allows you to create, edit and delete notes.

The biggest drawback of Planner Pro is typical of free apps. In exchange for the
opportunity to enjoy it at no cost, you'll have to tolerate multiple ads.

💵 **Price**: free

## Other Worthy Planner Apps to Check

The list that we have shared in this article is by no means exhaustive. We just
picked our personal favorites. If you want more, consider checking ClickUp,
Clockify, Proofhub, Twobird and Things 3. All these apps are not as large-scale
and versatile as LeaderTask and Trello. But they have amassed their loyal
audiences and their developers keep improving them, so they might be worth your
attention.

## Final Thoughts

There are dozens of planner apps on the market. It won't be a problem for you to
select the optimal one for your mobile or desktop device. Apps differ in
pricing, functionality and visual aesthetics.

If you download a free daily planner app, its functionality will probably be
limited or you'll have to watch annoying ads. The average price of a monthly
subscription is around $5 per individual, which includes full functionality and
no ads. Some apps charge more, others offer annual subscriptions or custom
pricing plans.

Some options enable you to only plan your agenda. Others boast advanced
features, such as time trackers, sharable lists, gamification and so on.
Business-oriented options offer Kanban boards, Gantt charts and seamless
integration with office apps. Students prefer lighter alternatives that might
fail to cope with complex projects – but have a lovely design and entertainment
features.

Before installing an app, analyze your budget, preferences and needs. Judging
from our personal experience, we can recommend LeaderTask as one of the most
powerful and user-friendly solutions. It offers a detailed overview of all your
tasks, lets you coordinate your actions with your team and significantly
increases the productivity of work.
