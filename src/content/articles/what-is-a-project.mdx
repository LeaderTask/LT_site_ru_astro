All products invented by man, drawings of houses and buildings, models and
constructions, technical means are projects. Someone once had the idea to create
them in the form in which they exist now. In fact, the project is the main
driving force that changes and transforms our world for the better.

The effectiveness of project management directly depends on the correct choice
of management methods and impacts. But, what does a project mean and what is it?
The choice of management techniques and methods depends on understanding its
meaning. Today we will understand how this definition is interpreted in
different areas of activity. What goals does each project pursue? What
organizational methods to use for its implementation?

## What is the project

The Big Encyclopedic Dictionary says that the concept of "project" comes from
the Latin language from the word "projectus" - "thrown, coming forward". It is a
temporary endeavor that results in the creation of a new, exclusive product,
service or result. A project can exist separately, or be part of a set of
programs. Their results can be tangible or intangible. The distinguishing
features of any project are:

- Limited in time. It has a beginning and an end, its own life cycle including
  several stages and phases. The number of stages may vary depending on the
  specifics and complexity. For example, opening a store is a project, and
  selling goods in it is a process.

- Uniqueness. Calculating a company's budget is a project, and paying employees
  monthly is also a process.

- A demonstrable result. This can be a completely new, non-existent product or a
  change to an existing product or process.

A limited amount of resources is provided for all projects. It is realized step
by step according to a preliminary plan. All activities and actions are called
project activities. By nature, a project can be universal or original, unique.
It develops in certain areas, in one way or another affecting the main
characteristics of the project. These include:

- Socio-cultural environment (local customs, traditions, ethical and moral
  values);

- International and political environment (state of the economy in the region,
  availability of resources, political sentiment and influences);

- Ecology, Environment.

Any changes in the external environment affect the progress of the project. They
can be both positive and negative.

## Aims and objectives of the project

![Aims and objectives of the project](/tseli-i-zadachi-proekta-1024x682.webp)

Project managers are in charge of project management. They are guided by a
handbook that contains rules and standards for working with projects, the
Project Management Body Of Knowledge or PMBOK, adaptable to any type of
enterprise.

It is the responsibility of project management to achieve all the goals set.
They are roughly divided into three categories:

1. A primary, strategic goal.

2. Objectives requiring mandatory achievement.

3. Desirable goals to fulfill.

The main goal shows how successful the project is. It is what the project was
designed for. It is formulated together with the mission. For example, the
creation of new software for mobile devices is the key objective, and the
mission is the problem that the developed application should solve. The
description of the goal and the theme of the project can be recorded in the
presentation.

Obligatory goals include intermediate stages, without which the main result
cannot be achieved. In the example of software development, these are concept,
code writing, testing and other stages that are aimed at creating the final
product. Desirable goals do not affect the final result, but make it better. In
our case, these are various additional options that make the software easier to
use.

The SMART approach is used to formulate project objectives. According to this
methodology, objectives should meet five criteria:

- Specific;

- Measurable;

- Achievable;

- Relevant to the company's overall strategy;

- Time-bound.

Based on the objectives, the method under which the project will be developed is
approved. It can be:

- Iterative (with repetitive approaches). It implies parallel work on tasks and
  their adjustment. Each life phase of such a project consists of repeating
  sub-cycles: design → implementation → analysis → adjustment.

- Spiral. When a new project is designed on the basis of already existing
  prototypes with simultaneous planning of "new spirals".

- Incremental, with the decomposition of large scale projects into smaller and
  less complex tasks.

## Classification of projects

Projects vary in activity, structure, size, duration, complexity and nature:

| Area              | Social; Economic; Technical; Organizational; Mixed.                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type of structure | Mono (individual); Complex (consisting of several projects); Megaproject (includes large scale projects united in a holistic system). |
| Duration          | Short-term (up to 3 years); Medium-term (3 - 5 years); Long-term (more than 5 years).                                                 |
| Complexity        | Simple; Medium; Complex.                                                                                                              |
| Size              | Small; Medium; Large; Very Large.                                                                                                     |
| Character         | Investment; Scientific Research; Education, Training; Mixed.                                                                          |

Projects are also considered in the form of sets of design and construction
documentation. They are developed according to the following scheme:

1. The result of the development is a package of documents.

2. On their basis, the task at hand is realized.

3. As a result of performing a task, there is a final material - a product, a
   material object.

Such schemes are used in the construction of buildings, structures, roads,
technological lines.

## Popular project management methodologies

Any project consists of the following stages:

- Initiating or deciding to establish.

- Planning, which includes formulating goals and strategy.

- Execution, with task allocation and execution.

- Controls, to evaluate the success of the actions performed.

- Completions or closings.

Competent project management is not an easy task, especially if a large team is
working on it, so its activities need to be organized and directed in the
"right" direction. For this purpose, special methodologies are used in the
project, including a kind of "rules of the game", which must be observed by all
participants. For example:

- Agile technologies that imply agile management. Small teams work, and each
  team performs its own task.

- Scrum framework assumes division of work into separate time intervals -
  sprints with daily organization of rallies by a Scrum master. This methodology
  is more popular in the IT sphere.

- Waterfall or cascade technique is based on the sequential execution of all the
  steps.

- The Kanban methodology, which is based on a whiteboard with task cards,
  provides high-quality visualization of all work processes.

## Conclusion

Projects vary in scope, value, timeframe, structure and nature. They are
implemented in different areas, including IT, construction, healthcare or
education. Such successful achievement of the goals of each project helps the
business to move to a new stage of development. The company gets additional
profit and invaluable experience for the realization of new ideas. For this
purpose, it is important to choose the right management methods and tools.
