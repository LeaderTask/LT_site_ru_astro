The life of modern man resembles an endless race with obstacles. If you
hesitate, stop and you are out of luck. There are bound to be more organized,
productive people ahead, who will do the job faster and better than you. In
order not to be confused, not to get lost in such an intense rhythm of life, it
is important to learn how to accurately and competently manage the most valuable
resource - time. Without it, it is impossible to build a successful career,
achieve high results, and become an effective manager.

Today we are going to talk about how to manage everything, do more in a shorter
time and get less tired, combine pleasant and useful. How to carefully plan your
work schedule so that there is time for studying, hobbies and socializing with
loved ones. To do this, we will use popular techniques, tools, and some
interesting time-management gurus and experts.

## Why you can't keep up with everything

There are many reasons that prevent you from becoming more successful in work
and life. The most common ones are:

- "Multitasking Mode". A modern manager should constantly try to improve his
  knowledge level, keep abreast of new trends in business and management,
  monitor competitors' activities and pay close attention to the needs of his
  team members. This requires enormous effort and great dedication, negatively
  affects the general emotional background, health, and usually leads to rapid
  burnout.

- Distraction by "empty", useless activities. This includes internet surfing,
  reading magazines and books during working hours, watching news on your
  smartphone, "hanging out" on social networks, computer games, TV series and TV
  shows.

- Natural laziness. Some psychologists say that laziness does not exist, but
  this quality is characteristic of all people. Therefore, you should not be
  particularly upset about the fact that from time to time you want to relax. As
  a rule, we are lazy because of fatigue or lack of adequate motivation to
  perform active actions. But if this desire turns into a way of life,
  interfering with performance, you need to take appropriate measures.

- Low productivity. Inefficient employees stretch simple tasks that can be
  safely completed within an hour into the entire workday. With such efficiency,
  it is difficult to achieve positive results.

- Lack of strength and energy. This phenomenon is associated with a sedentary
  lifestyle, poor nutrition, lack of physical activity.

Understanding what shortcomings to get rid of, what to optimize, what to strive
for, let's try to figure out how to manage everything and not get tired.

## Where to start

People who constantly complain that they do not have time for anything, do not
know how or do not want to properly manage their time, believing that it is
difficult and impossible. In fact, it is possible to manage this valuable
strategic resource rationally, and absolutely everyone can do it, using
practical step-by-step instructions and principles of time management.

Time management is a set of effective technologies and tools for planning and
time management. With their help you can effectively organize your work
processes, get rid of unnecessary fuss, overload and related stress. This
discipline teaches how to find approaches to time optimization, how to work and
live right "here and now", optimally distributing the load by hours and days of
the week in the right order.

If you want to feel relief and figure out how to keep up with everything and
live life to the fullest, when making plans try to follow the main principle of
time management: measure your time not in days and hours, but in actions and
events. This approach will help you improve your quality of life and give you an
understanding of how to build your schedule for your personal benefit.

## Formation of healthy habits

A successful person knows the value of time, knows how to discipline and
organize himself. In order to get rid of laziness and procrastination and easily
accomplish all the planned tasks during the day, it is important to develop
useful habits:

### Get up earlier

Having studied the biographies of famous people, big businessmen, we can
conclude that all of them by nature are "larks", that is, they go to bed early
and wake up early in the morning. This is not surprising, because most of us
have a peak of productivity falls precisely on the morning hours. It is worth
planning serious work for this period more often. From a quality start in the
morning, largely depends on the success and productivity of the coming day. And
the whole life.

To improve efficiency, it is not enough to set your alarm clock for 6:00 am. It
is important to spend this part of the day wisely and usefully. That is, devote
it to meditation, planning or reading. Even if early rising is not part of your
home routine, try to get up at least a few minutes earlier than usual. After a
week, increase this interval even more, and so on. After a couple of months, you
will be able to increase this interval much more and you will be able to easily
wake up an hour earlier to spend this time rationally and efficiently.

### Keep your work and life in order

It is impossible to feel organized and successful in chaos. You will never have
enough time to complete important tasks by clearing the "rubble" of documents,
records or files stored in your computer. Maintaining order in the workplace, on
your personal computer, in your home, in your car, has a positive effect on your
psyche, disciplines you, and teaches you self-organization. These skills will
help you achieve better results at work and in life. Keeping things in order
will be much easier if you adhere to the following tips:

1. Get rid of everything unnecessary.

2. Allocate a separate place for each item.

3. Get in the habit of putting it in there every time you use it.

4. Stop cluttering your home and office with trifles, unnecessary "bling" bought
   at sales. On the weekend, when you have a lot of free time, clean the house,
   for example, by washing dishes.

5. Learn to consume sustainably.

By properly organizing the space you're in, you'll have a couple of hours to do
the really important things.

### Plan every day

You will be surprised, but many people of the past centuries, such as artists,
writers, scientists, who lived several centuries ago, started their mornings by
creating to-do lists, and in the evening they summarized their work. Properly
planning your time, you will clearly see how to manage to do everything in a
day. Having a complete picture of the day in front of you, you will be able to
focus on the main tasks. Thanks to the to-do list, relieve your brain of
unnecessary information. After all, it is very difficult in a huge number of
daily tasks, not to lose sight of something really important.

By gradually crossing off completed tasks from your list, you will get to know
the pleasant feeling of self-sufficiency. You will realize that you have spent
the day productively and usefully. The main thing is not to overestimate your
own capabilities and not to turn the plan into a list of continuously changing
tasks. It is enough to solve two to three key issues that need to be completed
during the day. When the skill is fully mastered, the number of tasks can be
gradually increased.

### Eliminate the chronophages

Once you calculate how much time you spend on useless activities, such as
watching TV, social networks, the Internet, talking "about nothing", you would
be surprised and shocked. Ah, these ruthless "time eaters" methodically take
away from you a huge amount of precious time. Therefore, you can and should get
rid of them.

If your list still has uncompleted tasks, you should not be distracted by empty
tasks. Analyze the items on your list. Determine what you can do right here and
now. Only after all the items are marked as completed, then the rest of the time
you can relax and reward yourself with a well-deserved vacation.

### Complete tasks in a timely manner

Problems that are not solved in time accumulate like a snowball. Therefore, they
should be dealt with as they come. Your car has broken down - plan a visit to a
service station in the near future. You need a scheduled medical examination -
be sure to set the task of visiting a polyclinic in the plan. This will save you
from the need to perform several important things at the same time.

## Planning and prioritization

![Planning and prioritization](/kanban-method-1024x372-1.webp)

Human capabilities are not limitless. Everyone has his own limit, which is not
reasonable and not right to exceed if you want to keep your strength and health
for many years. That is why it is better to do complicated, serious things
first. If you start the day with trifles, you will simply not find the strength
and time for global, important tasks. They will have to be postponed "for
tomorrow". And the next day there will still be distracting situations that
prevent them from being completed successfully.

To avoid this, you should divide the tasks on your to-do list by complexity. The
larger ones should be started in the morning or before lunch so that they can be
completed before the end of working hours. You can use the famous Eisenhower
matrix, which is a table of four boxes, to divide things by importance and
priority. It will look like this:

|                   | Urgent | Not urgent |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| It's important    | I      | II         |
| It doesn't matter | III    | IV         |

- Box I includes urgent and important matters. Do them first.

- In column II, write down important but not urgent tasks. These are done when
  key issues are closed.

- Item III includes urgent but not essential matters. These are dealt with as
  far as possible and necessary.

- Well, the tasks from column IV, which are not urgent and not important, are
  postponed "until better times".

In order to achieve better results with less effort, it is worth following the
following golden principles:

- Set clear and realistic goals for yourself. They should be challenging and
  ambitious enough. Visualize your dream and write its content in a plan. Focus
  on the main thing. Spreading between desires, you will not achieve a positive
  result. If there are difficulties in achieving your goal, do not give up on it
  immediately, look for other ways.

- Practice task decomposition. That is, divide large tasks into smaller and more
  understandable ones. Each successfully completed step should bring you closer
  to the main goal. The larger the task - the farther it should be located in
  the general tree of goals. Small, intermediate tasks should be planned daily,
  at the end of the working day. This will make it easier to "get into work" in
  the morning. You will simply sit down at your workplace and start doing what
  you have planned. As a result, you won't need to keep unnecessary information
  in your head. Seeing in front of you the current tasks for the day, you will
  progressively solve them, one by one, without distracting on secondary issues.
  This will allow you to complete your work more quickly and efficiently.

- Avoid multitasking. The ability to do several things at once is a myth. With
  this approach to business there is always a risk of missing out on something
  important. In addition, according to research by scientists at the University
  of London, simultaneous work on several single-valued tasks leads to a
  critical drop in IQ. Then the quality of their fulfillment is out of the
  question. Therefore, we choose three key tasks for the day and make maximum
  effort to accomplish them.

## Simple rules for organizing time

![Simple rules for organizing time](/time-management.webp)

Time management has developed special models and methods that help to organize
work with tasks competently and make planning effective. We will familiarize you
with some of them:

### The "five-minute rule"

Short things that take little time, require little effort and need to be done
immediately. Do you need to make a dental appointment? You don't need to put
this item on your daily schedule. Pick up the phone and make an appointment.

### 90 by 30 method

According to this methodology, developed by American journalist Tony Schwartz,
you should start your morning by identifying a more difficult task and
completing it immediately. Work on it for 90 minutes. Then allocate 30 minutes
for rest, which should be of the highest quality and full.

### Pomodoro technique

Francesco Cirillo's method suggests his best way of working with task lists.
They should also be graded from the most important to the least important. The
author divides working time into 30-minute segments, "tomatoes", which include
25 minutes of active work on the task and a 5-minute break for rest. The
performed tasks should be marked with a cross after each "tomato". After four
approaches, you should take a break for 15-30 minutes.

## Helpful Lifehacks to Increase Productivity

There are many secrets and approaches to planning and improving
self-organization. We offer a simple checklist that will suit absolutely
everyone:

1. Keep a written record of all to-do's and tasks. You can use a notebook, paper
   post-it notes or a modern digital app. Recorded thoughts and other
   information will not be lost or forgotten.

2. Evaluate your effectiveness in a way that is convenient for you. Don't be
   lazy to check your plan every day, week or month and evaluate how
   successfully you have accomplished all the items. This will help you
   understand what direction to take next.

3. Set clear, understandable and measurable goals. Then it will be easier to
   achieve them.

4. Learn to delegate. By locking all tasks on yourself, you will make it very
   difficult to implement the chosen strategy. After all, you may have force
   majeure circumstances that prevent you from accomplishing things on time.
   Delegate tasks so that together with your colleagues you can cheerfully come
   to the desired result, and not crawl to the goal squeezed and exhausted.

5. Keep everything in order. Living in chaos is not conducive to making good
   decisions.

6. Learn to say no. First of all, answer yourself, your desires and "wants". Not
   all dreams should be realized, taking into account the benefits, resources
   for achievement and efficiency.

7. Take breaks to relax, including from planning. Sometimes you can let things
   go and let life take its course.
