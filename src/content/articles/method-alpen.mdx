Trying to do a huge number of things in a day, we are literally torn to pieces.
As a result, by the evening we realize that most of them are not finished or
done in the wrong way. Because of this there is a feeling of irritation and
despair. There is a reasonable question: how to plan the day to keep up with
everything and less tired? For this purpose, time management uses various
techniques. One of the ways of effective time management is the Alpa method,
developed by the German economist and psychologist Lothar Seivert.

## What is the essence of the Alpen method

The system of daily planning with the poetic name "Alps" has nothing to do with
the famous mountain range located in Europe. It got its name thanks to five
elements, the first letters of which form the German word: "Alpen":

- A (Aufgaben) - task lists;

- L (Länge schätzen) - the time required to perform them;

- P (Pufferzeiten einplanen) - planning "stockpile";

- E (Entscheidungen treffen) - proper prioritization of tasks by importance and
  priority;

- N (Nachkontrolle) - summarizing and analyzing.

The principle of the method is based on the proper prioritization of tasks. For
this purpose, tasks that need to be performed in the first place are selected,
and minor tasks that do not require urgent fulfillment are separated from them.
They are postponed "for later". In the planning process, special attention is
paid to the rational allocation of time so that there is enough time for all
tasks.

The methodology is not something new or exceptional. It combines the
tools Eisenhower matrix, the technologies classical time management and the
basics of B. Franklin's goal setting.

By adhering to a simple algorithm, every person can organize his day in such a
way that he or she will have enough time for all serious business and
full-fledged rest. By spending only 15-20 minutes in the morning to draw up a
plan, you can spend the rest of the day with greater benefit for yourself and
your business.

## Advantages and disadvantages

By using the Alpa method of time management, personal efficiency can be
improved. The advantages of this tool are:

- Ability to free up up to 20% of your free time.

- Structuring of tasks, prevention of emergency situations.

- Improved relationships in your work team and in your personal life. By
  managing to finish important tasks, you will gain inner peace and
  self-confidence. You will be able to pay more attention to your family and
  loved ones.

- Prevention of stressful situations. In the constant race for results, a person
  experiences tremendous stress due to overload and chronic fatigue. Learning to
  handle time correctly, correctly prioritizing, you can avoid unnecessary haste
  and nervousness. This will favorably affect the psychological state.

There are disadvantages to this method of planning as well. Among them it is
worth noting:

- Dependence on the character, personal qualities of a person. In order to
  perform all the necessary steps of the Alpa method, it is necessary to have
  discipline and the ability to self-control.

- Lack of explicit motivation. To achieve effectiveness using this methodology,
  it is important to clearly follow all the steps without receiving any reward.
  This is not easy, especially in the initial stages.

## How the Alpa method works

The Alpa method planning technology is designed for self-managers and business
executives who want to bring order within the company. It helps to improve
productivity without additional time and stress. You just need to follow all its
steps step by step.

### 1\. Compilation of task lists

Daily planning starts with making lists of tasks for the day. It is best to do
this in the evening. On a piece of paper or in an electronic application, make
lists of the things that need to be done during the day. You can use the
Eisenhower method to categorize them by importance and priority. Divide the
sheet of paper into three columns:

- In the first one we put the most urgent, important, urgent tasks that need to
  be solved first.

- In the second column write down the tasks that must be done during the day.

- In the third should be small, non-urgent tasks that can be put off "for
  later".

The lists should also include unforeseen cases, force majeure tasks that may
appear during the day. But small, unimportant tasks that take no more than a few
minutes to complete should not be added to the list.

These nightly exercises will help you to concentrate on your main tasks. They
can be highlighted in different colors for clarity. It is not advisable to plan
in your mind. It is difficult for the average person to keep in memory more than
four tasks at the same time. There is always a risk of forgetting or missing
something. That is why you should write down all your daily goals.

### 2\. Time analysis

Probably everyone has noticed at least once that the same task can be completed
in different amounts of time. You can spend several hours or no more than 30
minutes on identical processes if you concentrate on the task at hand and don't
get distracted by extraneous factors.

Therefore, when planning tasks for the day, it is important to set yourself time
limits. Then they will be completed quickly and promptly.

### 3\. Creating a time reserve

According to the rules of the Alpa methodology, all tasks planned for the day
should be solved in 60% of the time. The rest of it should be left for
unforeseen matters. If you work for 8 hours, you should meet the 5-hour
deadline. To do this, you can use different ways: accelerate the pace of work,
delegate tasks to subordinates or colleagues. In order to quickly cope with any
tasks, they need to be properly prioritized on your to-do list. If some tasks do
not fit at all into a tight schedule, they are postponed to the next day.

### 4\. Completion of conceived cases within the established time frame

The schedule of tasks should be adjusted to the time defined in the previous
step. If you allocated 5 hours out of an 8-hour workday, you need to make sure
you meet that time. Shorten the deadlines for each task so that they can all fit
into a tight schedule. Delegate some errands to coworkers. Postpone the rest of
the tasks to the next day as well.

Small tasks that don't require concentration and focus can be done in between
major tasks. On the way to a meeting, check email, call a client, or make a
schedule for the next day. First of all, you should do the things from the third
column on the list. Perhaps some tasks can be done during these breaks.

### 5\. Evaluation and summarization

When reviewing your lists, pay attention to the things you didn't manage to
accomplish during the day. Perhaps there are tasks that you keep postponing. In
this case, you should think about their expediency and importance. If the case
is important, you need to fulfill it immediately. And if the task is
unimportant, it is canceled and crossed off the list.

## Conclusion

efficiency. Using this technology to organize personal and working time, you
