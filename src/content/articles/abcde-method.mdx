Effective time management is an important skill that every successful person
needs. Planning helps you organize your life and work so that you can accomplish
more important things in less time. In modern time management there are many
planning techniques. There is no universal variant among them, everyone chooses
a method and tools for himself according to his personal preferences and goals.

Today we will take a closer look at one of the famous planning techniques
developed by motivational coach, Brian Tracy, author of the best-selling book,
Eat the Frog. It can be used to assess and organize to-do's so that you can
properly categorize them in your daily plans by importance and priority.

## Why it's important to manage time

![Why it's important to manage time](/why-important-time-management.webp)

If you do not know how to manage your own time rationally, you cannot manage
anything else. It is difficult to disagree with this statement made by the
American economist Peter Drucker. Time management is one of the top 10 skills
that managers want to see in their employees. They prefer to work with
performers who complete their tasks on time, respect deadlines, know how to
prioritize and plan their day.

In order to properly handle time, first of all, it is worth identifying the
reasons that prevent you from using it rationally. These include:

- Procrastination, the persistent desire to put things off until later.

- Perfectionism, accompanied by a fanatical desire to bring all tasks to
  perfection.

- Lack of knowledge in a particular area that does not allow for prompt
  completion of assigned work.

- Lack of skill in time management tools and techniques.

All of these bottlenecks can be eliminated by practicing willpower and
self-discipline.

## What is the essence of the ABCDE method

Another name for this technique is: "Assessing Consequences". The essence of the
ABCDE method is to make daily lists of tasks and prioritize them. It is quite
simple to execute, but it produces excellent results.

Every morning you start by making a list of all the things you need to do during
the day. You can do this on a regular piece of paper or use an electronic
planner. You don't need to follow any system when adding them. Include in the
list of work, personal tasks. Next, they need to be distributed by priority
groups. To do this, each item is marked with the corresponding letter:

- A - critical matters involving serious consequences in life and work.

- B - mandatory tasks that also need to be urgently completed, but the
  consequences for not completing them will not be as serious as in the first
  case.

- C - they are desirable to accomplish, but nothing will happen if you postpone
  them to a later time.

- D - matters whose execution can be entrusted to others.

- E - you can safely forget about them and remove them from the list. These are
  useless, irrelevant or imposed by someone from the outside and will not bring
  any positive result.

If there are several things with the same letter in the general list, number
them in the order of priority: A1, A2, A3 and so on. After you finish working
with the list, you will have a checklist for the day. You should perform its
items step by step, starting from the position marked with the letter A1. You
can move on to the next tasks only after the previous ones are completed.

## How to use the ABCDE method in practice

In order not to get confused in the records, it is most convenient to arrange
the daily affairs in the form of a table:

| Group | Tasks                                                                                                                                           | Prioritization of execution |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| A     | Submit a design layout for the website Negotiate with the client Refill the balance of the advertising office Sign up for a medical examination | A1 A2 A3 A4                 |
| B     | Pay utility bills Advertise your car for sale Perform vehicle maintenance                                                                       | B1 B2 B3                    |
| C     | Delete spam and clean up emails Visit an exhibition Meet with friends                                                                           | C1 C2 C3                    |
| D     | Organize a corporate event for employees Perform general cleaning                                                                               | D1 D2                       |
| E     | Leave a comment on Check out the series recommended by people you know                                                                          | E1 E2                       |

When the table is completed and labeled, you can proceed to perform the actions
described in the table:

1. We cross off the D group to avoid distractions. You can safely forget about
   them.

2. Start working from point A1. Do not let the deadline be missed, the final
   result should be submitted to the project manager.

3. Then we perform no less important, but not so urgent tasks: call the client,
   throw money into the advertising cabinet (there is still a small balance, but
   you can not delay with this issue).

4. Make an appointment with your doctor, as keeping healthy is always a
   priority.

5. Utilities must be paid on time. Then we submit an advertisement and do a
   technical inspection after the completion of other urgent matters.

6. Assign tasks from group D to other performers. Your deputy can organize the
   corporate party, and hire a cleaning service for the general cleaning. Then
   you will have enough time to do other things and have a good rest.

By following this method, it will be easier for you to focus on your primary
tasks to manage your time with quality and efficiency.

### Вопросы для категории А

A list of the following questions will help you understand how important a task
is:

- Doing what actions will bring me closer to my main goals for that day, week,
  month or year?

- Is it possible, having accomplished one task, to solve other cases with it?

- Which ones will be of great benefit or good financial reward to me?

- What tasks will help contribute the most to the company, the business?

- Which ones, if not met, will have the most negative consequences?

## How to combine the ABCDE method with other time management techniques

The ABCDE prioritization technique fits perfectly with another of Brian Tracy's
techniques: "Eat the Frog". Its meaning is that you should start any day by
accomplishing the most difficult and unpleasant tasks. That is, important things
related to key goals and results should be at the top of the prioritization
list. Once they are completed, you can move on to other tasks. This way you will
get rid of nervousness and stress, because the most difficult work will be done.

In practice, this method combined with the ABCDE technique works like this:

You have made a to-do list of the following items:

- Finish the presentation - A1;

- Reply to letters - A4;

- Calling customers - A3;

- To amend the contract - A2.

Having completed voluminous, labor-intensive projects, first of all, you will be
able to concentrate better, you will not be distracted by extraneous matters.
That is, you will definitely bring them to completion.

An Eisenhower matrix can also be used to categorize cases by importance and
priority. Both methods are similar but have a number of differences:

|                                       | Eisenhower matrix            | ABCDE method |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| Important matters                     | Squares A and B              | Category A   |
| Urgent, but not paramount             | Square C                     | Category B   |
| Important but not urgent              | Square D                     | Category C   |
| Tasks that can be delegated to others | Square C (sometimes A and B) | Category D   |
| Unimportant, minor matters            | Squares C and D              | Category E   |

The Eisenhower method and the ABCDE technique can be used to analyze short-term
and long-term tasks. For example, make a detailed plan for a week or month,
evaluate the importance of all the tasks in it, put the most important
activities in the first positions, think about which tasks can be delegated to
others, and which ones should be abandoned immediately. Then you will only need
to check this list regularly to plan the day's activities.

## How the ABCDE method works in LeaderTask

![Best Calendar Apps](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

You can use various tools to plan your time using the ABCDE method. For example,
an ordinary notebook, a diary or a modern business organizer LeaderTask, which
combines the functions of a planner, task manager and project management system.

A full set of time management techniques, including the GTD system and Brian
Tracy's ABCDE methodology, is built into the application. The planner is
suitable for all types of planning. Thanks to the convenient customization
system, you can easily deal with any tasks. Distribute them according to their
importance, transfer unfinished tasks to the next day. You will be able to
divide large, voluminous tasks into smaller ones, so that you can consistently
perform them stage by stage, in small steps. Set deadlines for each task and
track them on a calendar.

The program will encourage you to be active by reminding you of deadlines for
completing tasks or scheduled meetings. The program will show your progress on a
visual graph. In LeaderTask you can manage your own or team projects, create
to-do lists, assign them to other executors, and monitor progress.

The app has a high-quality mobile version, synchronizes with many popular apps,
works on all digital platforms, including without internet.

## Conclusion

Working with a list of tasks from the very first day increases productivity by
25%. For the best results, it is better to plan from the evening, at the end of
each working day making a list of things to be done tomorrow. When a new task
appears, it is added to the general list, taking into account the priority.
After each task is completed, it is crossed off the list. This will be a great
motivation for further work.

Every minute of planning saves up to 20 minutes of time. Therefore, it is worth
taking this process responsibly and seriously, choosing the most convenient
methodology for yourself, for example, ABCDE. By clearly prioritizing, you will
increase your productivity, learn to manage time, and always meet deadlines. To
increase your productivity even more, use modern tools, such as the LeaderTask
service, which will help you control all your tasks in one system.
