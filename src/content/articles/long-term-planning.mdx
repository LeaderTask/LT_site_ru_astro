Depending on the urgency, planning can be short-term, medium-term and long-term.
In this article we will characterize long-term planning and analyze its
peculiarities in detail.

## What is long-term planning

Long-term planning involves setting ambitious goals and developing a plan of
action over a significant period of time. The planning horizon usually ranges
from one to several years. Long-term planning involves a systematic approach to
organizing one's time, resources and efforts to achieve certain results in the
future.

When it makes sense to make long-term plans:

1. **Career Development.** Long-term career planning includes steps for
   advancement, learning new skills, participating in projects, and preparing
   for possible shifts in job or field.

2. **Financial Sustainability.** Create a long-term financial plan that includes
   retirement, investments, saving for large purchases (real estate, car) and
   family financial security.

3. **Health and well-being.** Planning a healthy lifestyle that includes regular
   medical check-ups, exercise, proper nutrition and self-care to ensure
   physical and psychological well-being.

4. **Personal development.** Developing skills, hobbies or pastimes, learning
   new languages, traveling, cultural enrichment, can all be incorporated into a
   long-term personal growth plan.

5. **Business and Entrepreneurship.** Develop the company's strategy for several
   years ahead, including plans for market expansion, introduction of new
   products or services, risk management and stability.

Long-term planning helps to set clear goals, organize resources, define
priorities and actions for the long term. It not only avoids impulsive
decision-making, but also ensures systematic movement towards desired results.

## When long-term planning is irrelevant

Long-term planning is not a one-size-fits-all solution for all situations. To
decide whether this method is appropriate in your situation or not you first
need to determine the context, circumstances, and your preferences and
lifestyle. While forecasting is a powerful tool for achieving global goals and
success, there are a few instances where its use may not be appropriate;

1. **Situations of uncertainty.** If the environment or circumstances are too
   unstable or unclear, it is worth abandoning ambitious plans. For example, in
   technology or innovation, where trends change rapidly, plans may become
   irrelevant before they are realized.

2. **When high flexibility is needed.** In entrepreneurship, a business is
   required to be flexible and able to adapt quickly to change. In this case,
   sticking too rigidly to plans can become an obstacle to making decisions as
   new factors emerge.

3. **Short-term goals or objectives.** For the sake of tasks and goals that can
   be promptly accomplished within a short period of time (e.g., a few days or a
   week), it is not worthwhile to make ambitious plans.

4. **Emergency situations.** In emergency situations where immediate action is
   required without the possibility of prior planning, responding to current
   circumstances becomes a priority. Long-term planning in such cases can be
   postponed in the name of speed and solving current problems.

5. **Individual preferences and work style.** Some people find it difficult to
   adhere to the strict framework of large-scale planning because of their
   personal needs, thinking style, or comfort level. Instead, they prefer more
   flexible methods of time and task management.

## Why a wish list isn't enough

A wish list, wish list or dream list is a great start to transforming your life.
A wish list encourages you to develop and move forward, but does not provide
concrete steps to achieve results. However, realizing cherished desires and
achieving long-term goals requires a more systematic and structured approach.
Here's why:

**Lack of specificity.** Often a wish list contains general items that are not
elaborated into specific goals. It may include things like "become successful"
or "travel a lot," but without defining what exactly is meant by "success" or
what places one wants to visit. Without specifics, goals can remain
unrealizable.

**Lack of an action plan.** Simply listing desires does not include the steps or
actions needed to achieve them. Planning and identifying specific steps are key
to achieving goals.

**Uncertainty and lack of motivation.** Without clarity and awareness of why
these goals are important, realizing them can be difficult. The more specific
and meaningful the goal is to us, the stronger our motivation will be to follow
a plan to achieve it.

**Lack of prioritization.** When your wish list is not structured or
prioritized, it can lead to scattered effort and wasted time on less important
things.

**Lack of evaluation and correction of the plan.** A simple wish list does not
cover mechanisms for evaluating progress and correcting the plan when necessary.
Regular review and correction are important steps in achieving long-term goals.

## How to set goals wisely

The SMART method is a system of criteria that helps to formulate goals
correctly. Each letter in the SMART abbreviation represents a certain aspect
that the goal should fulfill:

1. **Specific - Certainty**.

2. **Measurable - Measurable**.

3. **Achievable - Achievable**.

4. **Relevant - Relevance**.

5. **Time-bound**.

The SMART method helps to translate abstract desires into concrete and
realizable goals, which are the basis for successful planning. The method
structures the process of setting goals, makes them more conscious, measurable
and controllable, which contributes to their more successful realization. This
method is widely used in planning both personal and corporate goals due to its
effectiveness and ease of application.

## Steps in creating a long-term plan

Creating a long-term plan requires a systematic approach and strategic thinking.
Let's look at the key stages in creating a long-term plan.

### 1\. Goal setting

Define your goals. Prioritize your goals with a 5, 10, or 20 year perspective.
Break your goals into categories such as career, personal development, finances,
health, relationships, and other aspects of life.

### 2\. Drawing up a plan

Develop an action plan. Break down the goals into specific steps to accomplish
each one. Prioritize and start with the goals that matter most. Set deadlines
for each sub-goal so you have a clear timeline for completion.

### 3\. Evaluation and adjustment

Evaluate and adjust the plan regularly. Celebrate all achievements towards your
long-term goals to keep you motivated. Review your goals regularly and track
your progress. Modify the plan as needed based on changes in circumstances or
your experience.

### 4\. Continuous development

Continually develop and utilize experience. Incorporate learning and development
of new skills into your plan to become more effective in achieving your goals.
Use your past experience when setting new goals, taking into account previous
successes and failures.

Making a long-term plan is a dynamic process that requires flexibility and a
willingness to change. Don't be afraid to review and adjust the plan to fit your
current circumstances and growth.

## Planning tools

There are many tools available to help you track your progress and reach your
long-term goals. Here are some of them:

### Eisenhower matrix

This method categorizes tasks into four categories of importance and urgency.
Tasks are divided into:

- **Important and urgent:** Requires immediate attention.

- **Important but not urgent:** Scheduled for a specific time.

- **Important but unimportant:** May be delegated.

- **Unimportant and non-urgent:** Often distract from the main tasks. It helps
  to determine what to focus on first.

### Pomodoro method

This is a time management technique that involves dividing work time into
25-minute intervals (tomatoes) followed by a five-minute break. After every four
tomatoes, a longer break (usually 15-30 minutes) is taken. This method helps to
maintain a high level of concentration and efficiency during the working day.

### Planning applications

Electronic task management and scheduling tools offer a wide range of features
that make it easy to organize to-do items and track progress. Such applications
allow you to plan, create task lists, group tasks into projects or categories,
set due dates, prioritize tasks, add additional details to tasks, and even share
lists with other users for collaboration. Some task managers even allow you to
create recurring tasks, rank cards by completion status, and split tasks into
subtasks.

### Planners and Diaries

Planners are usually calendars with preset sections for each day, week or month.
They allow you to keep a record of plans for specific dates, set priorities, and
mark important events and to-dos. Diaries, on the other hand, usually have more
space for free writing, allow you to express more detailed thoughts and ideas
for each day.

Long-term planning is a powerful tool for achieving goals, although it is not
universal. It is effective in stable environments where goals and circumstances
are relatively predictable. However, in unstable or uncertain situations where
flexibility and adaptability are required, long-term planning will not be
effective.
