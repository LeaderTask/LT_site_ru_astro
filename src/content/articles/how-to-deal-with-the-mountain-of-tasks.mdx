  and regain control of your life using LeaderTask.

Everything begins with several cases. You manage to execute almost all. Suddenly
couple of new are added to them. Then "arrive" cases on job. Then several
personal tasks. You carry the small personal project, and, certainly, there are
tasks too.

You begin to be perplexed with what business to begin, they crowded much. You
hold some affairs in the head, others are written in the daily log, on stickers,
pieces of paper. Chaos.

You try to systematize some tasks, but new tasks quickly break system.
Permanently something is forgotten on a trifle.

You permanently are nervous.

When you distribute affairs on days, use the golden rule of planning:

**Plan no more than 80% of working hours!**

By the way, all tasks will remain in projects. They will have a sign – specific
date.

You can click for any day in the calendar and see the to-do list of this day:
