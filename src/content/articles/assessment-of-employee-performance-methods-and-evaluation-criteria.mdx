  losses, and foster a thriving work environment.

The success and stability of any company depend on the efficiency of its
employees. Some people genuinely earn their salaries, while others create the
appearance of active work while attending to personal matters. Assessing the
effectiveness of personnel helps determine how each employee's actions impact
the company's productivity. It demonstrates how well an employee matches their
position and whether their salary level corresponds to their contribution to the
company's development.

## Why Assess Employee Efficiency

According to statistics, 70% of company employees are constantly distracted from
their work processes. The use of messengers, social networks, and personal calls
during working hours all hinder the ability to focus on their core
responsibilities. Only 40% of employees understand the essence of the tasks
assigned to them by their supervisors. As a result, companies lose 20 to 30% of
their revenue annually due to this inefficiency.

To avoid losses caused by the irrational use of labor resources, employee
efficiency assessment is applied. It is a system of criteria that determines how
well a person fits their position and how they handle their assigned tasks.
Studying employee productivity is beneficial not only to managers but also to
the employees themselves.

"Assessing Employee Efficiency: Why It Matters

During the research, the following factors are taken into account:

1. The volume of work performed by the employee.

2. The complexity of the tasks.

3. Compliance of the tasks performed with job responsibilities.

4. The results of the work and the time spent on its completion.

5. Resources expended.

Assessing employees helps achieve the following goals:

1. Determine the skills, abilities, and professional level of employees.

2. Make the right personnel changes.

3. Improve the existing KPI (Key Performance Indicator) and motivation system
   within the company.

4. Eliminate chaos and disorder in the workforce.

Based on the results of employee assessments, various strategic decisions can be
made that have the potential to benefit the company. For example:

1. Develop a promotion matrix for employees.

2. Create a checklist system based on the actual level of employee knowledge.

3. Establish a plan for employee training and development, including agreements
   with training organizations.

4. Identify candidates for managerial positions who can grow from line workers
   into competent leaders.

5. Analyze work processes and identify weaknesses in the company's business
   strategy.

Preliminary personnel assessment is necessary, especially when a company
experiences constant employee turnover or a decrease in labor productivity. It
is also essential when employees complain about poor working conditions,
disrespectful treatment, or low salaries.

Employee assessment is performed in the following cases:

1. In workforce planning.

2. When hiring new personnel for the company.

3. During training and development programs for managers.

4. To establish a talent pool.

Analyzing indicators that characterize the efficiency of personnel usage allows
the company to hire people with the required qualifications, knowledge, and
abilities, significantly reducing expenses on recruitment agencies and the
number of job interviews.

Improving the efficiency of each employee can be achieved through:

1. Mutual commitment to work. To ensure that every team member works to their
   full potential, the manager should outline opportunities for growth and
   reward employees with bonuses or incentives. This creates a positive outcome
   for both parties: employees improve their well-being, and the organization
   gains additional profit through the rational use of labor resources.

2. Transforming personal interests of subordinates into a tool for increasing
   their efficiency. Understanding each individual's interests can be used as a
   motivation tool.

3. The manager's interest in the success of employees. When team members feel
   valued and essential to the company, they will put in their best effort to
   justify the trust placed in them.

4. Creating a comfortable work environment.

It is essential to regularly assess the competence and quality of employees'
work. This is understood by every business representative. However, the question
remains: how to do it correctly? After all, a person can perform their duties
well but constantly distract colleagues, seeking their help, or fail to meet
established deadlines. For this reason, the effectiveness of each employee is
determined based on multiple indicators, including labor costs and time spent on
work.

In Japan, for example, this indicator is determined based on each employee's
abilities.

Based on the assessment of employee performance, companies develop bonus and
reward systems and make decisions about promoting employees to new positions or
terminating their employment."

"Evaluation Criteria for Employee Performance

To properly assess an employee's efficiency, it is necessary to consider their
work-related, personal, and behavioral characteristics. Evaluation criteria are
developed in collaboration between company managers and HR representatives or
with the employees themselves.

Collaboratively developing evaluation criteria has several advantages for the
company. They are more understandable to management and employees, do not lead
to resistance from employees, and are based on the specifics of each individual
work process.

Evaluation criteria can be categorized based on their scope, assessment method,
and objectivity into:

1. General organizational and specialized.

2. Quantitative (assessing achieved results) or qualitative (considering
   individual employee qualities and the quality of their work).

3. Objective (standards established for each work process) or subjective (formed
   based on expert opinions).

4. Integral or simple.

The development of evaluation criteria begins with identifying a list of job
positions. Then, the functional responsibilities of the selected groups are
determined. The feasibility of applying criteria for each specific case is
analyzed. The amount of information about the object of study is taken into
account, the importance of each evaluation criterion is clarified, and it is
adjusted to fit the peculiarities of each specific work process.

Competency Assessment

This assesses the professional, personal qualities, and knowledge of employees,
including:

1. Professional skills, which are assessed based on tests, exams, compliance
   with industry standards.

2. Communication skills, which help determine an employee's position in the
   team, whether they are a leader or an outsider, whether they have conflicts
   with colleagues, and their loyalty to coworkers. This information can be
   obtained through psychological tests and interviews conducted by the HR
   department.

Competency assessment also includes the execution of job responsibilities, work
attitude, work discipline, and loyalty to the company.

Employee Performance

The results of each employee's work are compared to the benchmarks set for their
position. Before assessing an employee's performance, specific tasks are
assigned to them. Performance is measured in terms of sales volume for a month,
the number of completed projects, or deals closed during the reporting period.

Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are expressed as a percentage and include:

- Sales divided by the number of processed calls.

- The number of repeat customer inquiries divided by the total number in the
  customer base.

- Results achieved divided by the resources expended.

To evaluate performance using KPI, a table is used, divided into two columns. In
one column, evaluation criteria (quantitative or qualitative, individual or
team-related) are recorded. In the second column, competencies approved for that
position are indicated. The head of the department assigns numeric values of 0
or 1 to the selected indicators, based on their own observations. The numeric
values in each row of the table should sum up to one.

KPI indicators have three levels:

- Basic (the starting point from which the result is counted).

- Normal (mandatory under any circumstances).

- Target or ideal (all employees should strive for this).

KPI indicators are evaluated at the end of the reporting period. The assessment
of qualitative values is made on a 100-point scale, while quantitative
indicators are measured using a metric system. To determine an employee's
specific performance, the following formula is used:

(Actual data minus basic KPI ÷ Normal minus basic) × 100% = result in
percentage.

The obtained data show how much the employee has met or exceeded the norm set
for them. If the KPI is above 100%, the employee's performance is high. If this
parameter is below 100%, it indicates that the staff is not working efficiently.

Each organization develops its own evaluation criteria, taking into account its
specific characteristics.

## Methods for Employee Performance Evaluation

Various methods are used to determine the effectiveness of employees in a
company. They can be categorized based on their direction and assessment
approach as follows:

**Qualitative Methods (Descriptive):**

1. **Matrix Method:** Employee characteristics are compared to a standard model
   corresponding to their position.

2. **Task Performance Evaluation:** Assesses how well an employee is performing
   their job.

3. **Critical-Incident Method:** A list of employee achievements and
   shortcomings is compiled, and conclusions about their professional
   suitability are drawn.

4. **360-Degree Feedback:** Employee performance is evaluated by colleagues at
   work, their immediate supervisor, and the employee themselves. Information
   about the employee is gathered through a questionnaire consisting of
   questions divided into separate sections related to the employee's
   performance.

5. **Group Discussion:** Conducted in the form of a direct discussion of the
   employee's work results with management and invited experts. By using this
   method, the stress resistance of the employee, communication skills with both
   staff and management, can be visually assessed. Questions can be asked by
   both parties during the discussion.

**Quantitative Methods:**

1. **Rating Method:** Employees receive scores for their work on a 10- or
   5-point scale, which are then aggregated and analyzed at the end of the
   reporting period.

2. **Free Rating Method:** An expert committee assesses the qualifications,
   skills, and characteristics of the employee, and the overall rating is based
   on their assessment.

3. **Ranking Method:** A commission of department heads creates a unique ranking
   of employees based on their performance and usefulness. After comparing data
   from different sources, employees at the bottom of the list may be dismissed
   or transferred to lower-paying positions.

**Combined Methods:**

1. **Summative Rating Method:** All employee characteristics are evaluated on a
   predetermined scale. The average score is calculated based on the collected
   data, which is then compared to the benchmark set for the position.

2. **Grouping System:** Employees are grouped into categories based on their
   performance, such as leaders, average performers, and underperformers.
   Decisions are then made regarding promotions or transfers.

These methods may provide an incomplete assessment of employee performance or
their socio-psychological qualities. Therefore, in recent times, comprehensive
methods based on a combination of all evaluation approaches have gained
popularity.

## **Competency Assessment Methods:**

These methods are used to conduct an in-depth analysis of employees'
professional qualities to effectively utilize a company's human resources. They
help calculate ways to increase labor productivity within the company and
develop measures to reduce costs associated with the employment of incompetent
workers. The following methods fall under this category:

1. **Certification:** Involves the evaluation of an employee's qualifications,
   practical and theoretical skills, as well as an analysis of their work
   results, personality traits, and professional characteristics. Certification
   is carried out based on standards established for each position and
   profession, with a frequency of once a year, once every six months, or once a
   year. The company's management has the right to certify all employees, except
   top managers, employees with less than one year of experience, or pregnant
   employees.

2. **Assessment Center:** Comprises three stages: preparation, scenario
   development, and the assessment process itself. The assessment includes
   business games, group discussions, interviews, and tests. This method
   provides an objective picture of how the staff corresponds to the goals,
   structure, and policies of the company but is primarily used in large
   companies due to its complexity.

3. **Testing:** Conducted based on professional and psychological tests to
   assess an employee's level of knowledge, their suitability for their
   position, and their personality traits.

4. **Interviews:** A series of questions is prepared for the employee to answer.
   Interviews can be conducted in an unstructured or structured format. The most
   effective method is a structured behavioral interview that allows the
   candidate for a position to simulate a specific situation from their
   professional activities, find a solution to it, and evaluate their role.

5. **Expert Assessment:** Professional and personal qualities of employees are
   evaluated by external or in-house specialists.

6. **Business Games:** A model of a real business situation is created. During
   the game, employees demonstrate their professional and personal qualities,
   teamwork skills, stress resistance, and ability to react quickly to changes
   in the work situation.

By applying these methods to assess employee effectiveness, it is important that
they are objective and understandable.

## Using the LeaderTask Program for Employee Performance Evaluation

Assessing the performance and productivity of company employees is a complex
process that requires significant time and patience from managerial staff. To
make the work of employees successful, it is important to set clear and
achievable goals for them, monitor task execution, and provide appropriate
evaluations of their actions.

A reliable tool for organizing the work time of personnel is specialized
software designed to systematize and efficiently solve various tasks. For
example, the modern planner LeaderTask.

The key to the successful operation of any team is the rational distribution of
tasks to competent employees. To achieve efficiency from employees, it is
necessary to:

- Assign them tasks that match their professional skills, abilities, and
  experience.

- Empower employees with authority that corresponds to their rank.

- Appoint a leader for each group.

The usefulness and effectiveness of employees need to be monitored. This can be
conveniently done with LeaderTask tools:

- A convenient task setting and control system. Adding a task to the system,
  assigning responsibility, and setting a deadline can be done in a few clicks.

- Clear visualization of employee effectiveness. Managers can view the results
  of each employee's activities on graphs or in statistical reports and draw
  appropriate conclusions.

- Prioritization of tasks. Important tasks are assigned a special status,
  allowing employees to focus on essential assignments, thus enhancing
  productivity.

The application's functionality also includes features such as task execution
control, organizer, task planner for iPhone, and other devices. By using the
program, you can avoid the loss of important information and unnecessary time
spent on key business processes, making the task execution process clear and
accessible to all employees.

Conclusion

The role of the HR department and company leadership is not limited to assessing
the effectiveness of employee work, identifying "problem areas," and dismissing
incompetent specialists. To achieve positive results from subordinates, it is
essential to offer them transparent and mutually beneficial collaboration in
return. The evaluation of employee performance should take the form of
constructive dialogue that benefits both parties.

The results of the assessment are documented in reports or tables that provide
detailed information about the employee. Based on this information, management
makes decisions about their continued employment within the company.

There are various methods for assessing performance, each with its own strengths
and weaknesses. Therefore, when choosing an assessment method, it is important
to consider factors such as the company's personnel structure, the specific
nature of its activities, and the relationships among employees.
