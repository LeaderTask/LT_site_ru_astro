One of the most in-demand, high-paying IT professions of recent times is
DevOps-engineer. This is a generalist who successfully copes with the functions
of a programmer and a system administrator. He is not engaged in solving
individual development tasks. He accelerates, optimises work processes with the
help of automation. We will try to tell in more detail in this review.

## What is DevOps

Software development has never been a simple process. Previously, many problems
arose due to the lack of direct interaction between different performers.
Developers wrote code, then its separate arrays were passed to testers for
testing. After testing, reports with errors were put into bulky folders and sent
back to the development department. The finished, tested code was passed to
sysadmins, who made it available to users by launching a new application or
update.

As a result, developers had no idea what problems administrators and testers
were having. The testers resented the confusion and code defects, and the
sysadmins were dissatisfied with the work of the entire development department
because bug fixing and subsequent testing took a lot of time, so the product
release was delayed again, even though the application was supposed to be
launched "as early as yesterday".

To remedy this situation, the development process was transformed into a single
cycle. This is how DevOps or Development Operations, a system of methods for
combining software development and operation processes, came into being. For the
first time this term was announced at the DevOps Days conference in Ghent
(Belgium) by consultant Patrick Dubois. He raised the issue of unifying the
spheres of software development and operation, inviting subscribers to discuss
the use of "agile methods in systems administration" by attaching the hashtag
#DevOps to the post. The approach quickly spread around the world and over time
became a full-fledged methodology of interaction between IT professionals,
turning development into a continuous, unified cycle.

Simply put, devop is a kind of cultural environment that helps programmers,
testers, and operations specialists communicate in the same language. They are
connected and united by DevOps engineers, versatile specialists who understand
programming and system administration. They actively interact with all
developers, managers, administrators, organising their work so that it brings
more practical benefit to the company. This is especially important for large,
large-scale projects and teams developing complex software products.

## Who is a DevOps engineer and what does he do

![Who is a DevOps engineer](/image-5.webp)

The DevOps-engineering profession is rapidly gaining popularity. Many IT
companies are interested in attracting highly qualified, multi-disciplinary
specialists capable of automating complex processes. Such universalists know
several programming languages and can successfully cope with the tasks of a
developer, sysadmin and tester.

So, let's take a closer look at what a DevOps engineer does. Each company
considers this concept in its own way. But the main task of this specialist is
to deploy and accelerate the release of a software product, to ensure
interaction between development and operation departments.

Regardless of the activities of the company in which a DevOps engineer works,
his job description includes:

1. Selecting software architecture and scaling during the planning phase.

2. Implementation of the development project road plan.

3. Monitor the health of development tools and environments.

4. Automation of product production at all stages, where possible. For example,
   organising testing in automatic mode.

5. Establishing communication and communication between all performers in the
   team.

6. Solving problems to accelerate, improve the work of developers, testing
   department, sysadmins and company managers.

In real life, a DevOps engineer often has to start work in more complicated
conditions, when the project was started without a clear plan, the architecture
was wrong, and the automation of its processes was decided to be implemented
after all the work "stood up". In such a situation, he must understand the
problems, solve them and make everything work smoothly and properly.

The hiring of a DevOps specialist is needed by companies that develop software
for their own use or for other clients. This position is needed in the following
situations:

- With a lot of competition in the market and the need to release product
  updates at an accelerated pace.

- In large teams including a large number of specialists of different levels and
  qualifications: developers, system administrators, testers.

- When developing numerous routine processes that require organisation and
  automation.

The DevOps Engineer ensures that development is conducted according to the
DevOps methodology. As part of his role, he/she performs the following tasks:

- Unites all the participants of the process: developers, testers, system
  administrators. Speaks the same language with them, understands their
  problems, owns their tools.

- Works with code repositories, setting up CI/CD systems, software
  containerisation tools, automated testing tools. Prepares product development
  and testing environments.

- Oversees all phases of development, helping to learn new tools and work
  methods in a timely manner, thinking through options to further simplify and
  improve processes.

## What knowledge and skills are needed in the profession

![What knowledge and skills are needed in the profession](/image-2.webp)

A DevOps engineer is a qualified, experienced high-level specialist with a
well-developed outlook and extensive knowledge in different areas,
simultaneously working in several IT areas. It is impossible to enter this
profession from the outside or from scratch. In most cases, this role is filled
by maintenance performers who have pumped up and improved their skills in the
field of software production.

Until recently, more than 70% of the tasks of such a specialist were related to
the maintenance and support of the project infrastructure, and only a small part
of them required knowledge in the field of development. But, recently, most
companies have increased their requirements to applicants for the position of
DevOps-engineer. They are interested in versatile specialists who, in addition
to technical support experience, have practical skills and programming
experience. This enables them to make faster decisions and promptly eliminate
errors that arise when working on a project.

Here's what a DevOps engineer should ideally be able to do:

- Understand the general principles of operating systems and have Linux
  administration experience.

- Work with SQL and NoSQL systems and databases.

- Knowledge of programming languages, including Bash, Python, Golang. Not
  necessarily at a high level, but a good DevOps engineer should read and write
  code.

- Understand how cloud technologies work (Google Cloud, Microsoft Azur).
  Required to describe tasks to developers.

- Proficiency in HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, DHCP, IPv4/IPv6, VPN, NAT, Firewall,
  networking experience.

- Set up web servers.

- Manage code using GitLab.

- Work with application containerisation tools (Kubernetes) as well as other
  tools (Git, Terraform, Docker, Prometheus, Ansible).

- Possess a technical, intermediate level of English.

The following qualities will be useful for this performer to be successful:

- Communication, interpersonal skills, ability to communicate and convey to the
  performers the peculiarities of functioning of complex systems in an
  accessible form.

- High level of engagement, interest in the work.

- Collectiveness, discipline, stress resistance.

- Initiative, desire to develop.

- A fresh unique perspective on development.

- Meet the requested technical requirements.

- Presentation Skills.

Having diplomas and certificates will be a plus. But most importantly, have a
relevant technical background and a willingness to share the values and approach
of the methodology. A specialist applying for the position of DevOps engineer
should have experience in the IT industry, possess systems thinking, understand
technology and be able to interact with other people. It is more than a job,
rather the DevOps philosophy can be called a lifestyle. If you are not ready to
constantly develop, learn, master and implement new technologies, you will not
succeed in this profession.

## Advantages, disadvantages of the profession, salary level

The main advantages of the profession are: its demand, excellent career
prospects, professional growth, and the opportunity to earn good money. The
number of vacancies is constantly increasing, and in the near future the demand
for such specialists will continue to grow. Other pluses of the speciality:

- A DevOps engineer solves tasks of different complexity and specificity,
  gaining new knowledge and skills. These skills can be successfully used in
  future work in any field.

- "Non-boring" work with a minimum of routine and repetitive tasks.

- Interesting practice in a professional environment.

Disadvantages of the profession:

- A DevOps engineer works in several IT areas at once, so he or she must be
  characterised by extensive and rich knowledge in different areas. In addition,
  it is very difficult to combine several activities at the initial stages.

- It does not have a clear working schedule. Software problems usually occur at
  the most unexpected times, and this should be taken calmly.

At the same time, the position of DevOps engineer is one of the highest paid in
IT companies. But the requirements for it are also high. Even a novice
specialist must have serious knowledge. Usually, experienced developers or
system administrators apply for the position of Junior DevOps Engineer. In the
rating of the best professions in the United States of America, this speciality
is in fifth place. In Russia, companies are prepared to pay DevOps Engineers a
high salary: on average, 2500- 5000 dollars.
