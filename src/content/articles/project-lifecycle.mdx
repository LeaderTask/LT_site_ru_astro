Any activity consists of projects. Each of them has a beginning, a length, and
an end. The period of time from the start to the end forms the project life
cycle (PLC). It includes certain phases, the completion of each of which is
accompanied by some result.

Understanding the characteristics of each phase helps managers and supervisors
to lead projects effectively. Minimize the risks associated with them. Improve
communication between implementers and customers. Be confident that the goal is
achievable with the available resources. Let's take a closer look at the main
phases and stages of a project. Let's try to understand how to use their
potential for successful project management.

## Essence, peculiarities of the project life cycle

![Project Life Cycle](/how-works-alpen.webp)

Project Life Cycle is a certain sequence of stages through which a project
passes. Their number, composition, and structure depend on the complexity and
specifics of the project. Regardless of the scale, project life cycles have the
following features:

- The beginning and the end of the project are characterized by low rates. The
  greatest amount of costs for its realization falls in the middle of the cycle.

- At the initial stage there is the highest level of risk, there are doubts
  about the success of achieving the planned result.

- It is easier to make any changes, to improve the methods of achieving goals at
  the initial stages of the life cycle. At later stages it is difficult or
  impossible to do so.

For business people, a project starts with the investment of monetary resources
to develop the business. The start and completion of a project is always
documented.

## Phases of the project life cycle

Any project life cycle consists of five phases:

1. Initiation;

2. Planning;

3. Execution;

4. Control;

5. Ending.

Usually they follow a set sequence, one after the other. But, sometimes, under
the influence of various external or internal circumstances, the team has to
return to the planning stage to make the necessary adjustments. The phases are
divided into stages of the project life cycle.

Let's look at the main phases of the project in more detail.

### Initiation

At this stage, the project is conceptualized. Preparations are made for its
planning and implementation. To begin with, it is necessary to approve the task
for the team. Make sure that its successful fulfillment will help to achieve the
desired result. In the initiation phase, there are many discussions, approvals,
research related to the existence of the future project. Meetings with potential
partners are scheduled. Common goals are defined. Their achievement will allow
the stakeholders to get the desired results.

The agreements reached are documented by fixing the main theses and agreements
in the Charter. This is a short, formal document describing the essence of the
project. It is the basis for further planning. The Charter contains the
following information:

- Purpose, mission;

- The benefits of its implementation;

- A list of possible threats and risks;

- List of partners and stakeholders.

In the Charter it is obligatory to specify the benefits of the project
realization for the business. This will give an understanding that all efforts
and costs will not be spent in vain.

### Planning

This stage is accompanied by a roadmap or detailed plan detailing the actions of
each participant. If we compare the life cycle of a project to the construction
of a house, the planning phase is where the development, cost estimates and
completion dates are approved. Because of neglecting the planning phase, about
half of the projects do not reach the final end, turn out to be unprofitable or
unrealistic.

At the planning stage, the workflow is broken down into small tasks. A suitable
team is selected and roles are distributed among the participants. Step-by-step
instructions with deadlines are developed. In order for the tasks to be
feasible, it is necessary to make sure that there are enough resources for them
during this phase.

After scheduling, designation of areas of responsibility, analysis of risks and
ways to prevent them, a general organizational meeting is held. At this meeting,
all the most important stages of the project are discussed. Tools for
accomplishing the tasks are selected. The result of the meeting should be a
clear understanding of each team member's role and degree of involvement in the
project.

Every performer and responsible person should have free access to the plan to
solve current issues. This will allow the team to always be aware of any changes
in the workflow.

### Execution

Returning to the example of building a house, we can say that in this phase
there is active work on laying the foundation, building the walls and the roof.
That is, all the plans are realized by the joint efforts of the team. The
execution phase starts right after the organizational meeting.

The manager's task at this stage is to control the performance of the work. For
this purpose, it is necessary to organize the rational distribution of
additional resources. Distribute assignments to subordinates, provide them with
references to the plan so that they can check with it as the work progresses.

### Control

This phase starts from the moment of initiation. In order to successfully
establish the workflow, it is important to follow up on the project from the
very beginning. This phase requires a certain amount of flexibility on the part
of the manager. Sometimes it is necessary to go back to the initial stage of the
plan to make adjustments. All changes are necessarily coordinated with the team
members and the client. For this purpose, interim meetings are organized, where
feedback from the participants on the workflow is considered. Changes and
additions are discussed.

### Completion

This is the final phase, marking the final completion of the project. At this
stage, the documentation is signed and handed over to the client or the team
that will work on the project in the future. Errors are analyzed. It is
necessary to do this in order to prevent their repetition in future work.
Information about the success is shared with clients, managers and other
stakeholders. All related documentation is placed in a centralized repository.

## Life cycle models and structure

The stages of the project life cycle are similar for all teams. However, they
may follow different models. The model describes in detail the order of
activities to be performed within the project. The lifecycle can function
according to the "waterfall" principle. This model is characterized by setting
strict time frames and strict compliance with all phases and stages of the
project. Using the cascade model of management it is possible to achieve
effective and accurate fulfillment of tasks at each stage. However, if errors
occur in the preceding stages, it is extremely difficult to correct them.

Other life cycle models:

- Spiral. Characterized by adjustments and changes at each turn. Emphasis is
  placed on risk management. Changes can be made at any stage of development.

- Incremental. Applicable for large, large-scale projects. In this case, large
  tasks are divided into smaller subtasks, which are solved gradually, one after
  another.

- Iterative. Provides control at each stage and minimizes risks, but increases
  the cost of project implementation.

- Semiotic. It is based on a careful examination of the logic and semantic
  structure of the project. Each step is evaluated in terms of feasibility and
  benefits.

Project life cycle structuring is necessary to organize effective interaction
and establish a hierarchy between all project components. With its help, a
smooth transition from simple goals to more complex ones is carried out.
Responsibilities are distributed, the load on the performers. The level of
expenditure of time and material resources is assessed. A transparent and
informative reporting system is created. The project structure is built on the
basis of the responsibility matrix. Two structuring methods are used for this
purpose:

- "Top-down", where a common, large task is broken down into smaller tasks to
  simplify execution;

- "Bottom-up", where many small goals are reduced to one, main goal.

## LeaderTask for effective project management

![LeaderTask](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

The realization of any project implies its breakdown into stages, phases and
clear tasks. If the project is simple enough, it can be managed using
checklists, to-do lists and tasks. For more complex projects, it is worth
applying modern methods and technologies, such as agile, lean, scrum, and
kanban.

This set of tools and techniques has been successfully implemented in LeaderTask
software. With the help of this application you can significantly save working
time, monitor the quality of task fulfillment. Perform and delegate tasks.
Achieve the set goals. The program is a complete system for organizing project
activities. Visualization of work processes is organized with the help of kanban
boards. In LeaderTask you can simultaneously manage several projects: personal
and general. They can be shared with colleagues, sorted, structured, moved to a
common list, and their progress can be monitored.

You will always be aware of any changes thanks to a convenient notification
system. The app also allows you to track employee performance by evaluating each
employee's productivity on a graph.

## Conclusion

The main goal of Project Lifecycle is to create a clear and simple structure for
project management and coordination. The success of the process depends on the
thoroughness, meticulousness of organization of all its phases and stages. The
lifecycle is necessary for fixing, understanding the general plan of project
activities. To organize them in a logical sequence. With its help it is possible
to control the goals, to fix the results at each stage. Automation helps to
ensure successful management at each stage. Using electronic programs for
monitoring and control, you can clearly see at what stage errors occur. Make
quick decisions to eliminate them.
