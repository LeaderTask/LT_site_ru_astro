Regulations will help retain team experience and automate staff training. Create
guidelines for new employees, share best practices and knowledge. Organize
experience sharing within the team to increase overall productivity.

In Regulations, you have access to a full text editor with the ability to add
links, videos, and images. Documents have privacy settings and you can invite
other users to create them. And if you need to assess how well an employee has
learned, add a quiz to the regulations.

##### Price: 55 $.

Once purchased, the Regulations plugin will be available to all license users,
both current and future.

**Note**: The plug-in works only in the Web-version of LeaderTask. Web-plugin is
purchased separately from the license once and for all.
