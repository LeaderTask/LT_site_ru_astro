A manager must be able not only to set goals, inspire employees, but also to
manage his own and team working time. The concept, definition of stages,
essence, types, rules and methods of effective time management will be revealed
in today's article.

## Time management and its importance for effective leadership

Competent management is the main key to the success of any company striving for
prosperity and development. And the characteristic feature of every good manager
is the ability to use working time rationally, to keep up with everything, and
to fulfill managerial duties in a timely manner.

At the same time, a modern manager, although making important decisions for the
company, is also obliged to monitor and manage not only his personal working
time, but also the time of his subordinates and the entire company as a whole.
This task can be performed either independently or with the help of a secretary.

## The main task of planning the manager's working day

The key function of time management is to eliminate the deficit of time, to
solve the problem with its constant lack of time to solve the planned tasks.
Effective planning eliminates the need to overwork, rush, and fuss, leaving
energy for something really important.

In addition, built discipline and organization in the office solves the issue of
lack of a plan, a large accumulation of unfinished business, increase motivation
in the team, get rid of the syndrome of constant fatigue and permanently close
the unpleasant problem with the completion of work at home.

## Myths about time management

The basic essence of the skill was formulated back in ancient Rome, almost two
thousand years ago. After all, time management has been of interest to people
since antiquity. In particular, this issue was dealt with in detail by Seneca, a
philosopher, poet and statesman. It is not surprising that since then the sphere
has been covered with a lot of myths and misconceptions, like any other topic
related to self-improvement and increasing personal efficiency.

Let's analyze these beliefs in order to understand what in this area is worth
believing, and what on the contrary a manager should not consider seriously.

### Myth 1. Time is beyond man's control

Part of the statement is true, because humans are indeed unable to turn back
time, change its speed, or adjust its other laws.

However, any person has the opportunity to learn how to manage their own
actions, competently organize activities without costs. And this allows everyone
to control personal and professional life, to have available labor hours as
efficiently as possible, to do more useful work in less time.

### Myth 2: Effective work is always intensive labor

The root of the misconception lies in the fact that most people do not
understand the essence of time management. Heavy workload, lack of rest, hard
and continuous labor often leads to overwork, apathy and even depression. And in
such a state it is impossible to increase personal productivity and achieve
major goals.

Time management implies not increasing the amount of work undertaken, but
concentrating most of the time on useful tasks, necessary actions. In addition,
effective management helps to avoid "chronophages" - time eaters.

### Myth 3. Planning deprives a person of freedom

Many people try not to get involved with time management because they are
convinced that time management constrains, turns a living person into a robot
who exists strictly according to a rational schedule. However, this is not the
case.

Competent and rational allocation of working time implies not only completing
projects, but also leaving time for rest. Time management helps to easily
accomplish a large number of work and personal tasks without stress, stress and
procrastination, and then spend time with loved ones or doing sports and
creative activities.

## Rules and principles of working time planning

There are several general recommendations for planning a successful working day,
which will allow not only the boss, but also a person in any other position to
be several times more effective throughout the working day. Let's consider them
in a little more detail.

### Rule 1. Rise at the same time

Maintaining a disciplined mind and body throughout the day is only possible by
observing the initial stage of any planning. Namely, getting up in the morning
at the same hour. Additional bonuses of getting up in the morning are a rested
body and a burst of energy.

### Rule 2. A positive attitude at the beginning of the day

Morning mood has a big impact on achieving goals throughout the day. Keeping a
gratitude journal, self-motivation minutes, reading affirmations, etc. - are
great early morning habits to do right after rising.

### Rule 3. Correct start of the day

A harmonious day is impossible without a favorable morning, the tone of which is
set by a well-slept and rested body, charged with energy and vigor. Therefore,
in no case sacrifice a good night's sleep, a healthy breakfast for the sake of
immediate desires in the evening and at night. Time management tells you to
prioritize properly.

### Rule 4. Consideration of different factors when planning workdays

Each person has certain periods of activity depending on their own biorhythms.
You should find out when your personal productivity peaks by observing yourself
for a few days or weeks. After that, when planning your day, you should place
the most important tasks in productive daily intervals, while periods of decline
are better left for rest, breaks, lunches, etc.

### Rule 5. Mandatory breaks during the day

A short rest during the working day is necessary for any person, as it allows
the body to recover and regain concentration for work. The duration and
frequency of breaks are set by each individual on a personal basis. However, it
is desirable to find in each hour at least a couple of minutes for rest. You can
use them to put your desk in order, wash your mug, water your flowers, take a
walk in the fresh air, etc.

### Rule 6. Bringing things to a conclusion

Constantly jumping from one thing to another, distracted by small and
unimportant activities (calls, answering messages, talking to colleagues) leads
to time theft. Try to bring each process to its logical conclusion before you
start another.

### Rule 7. Making good use of free time

Uninformative meetings, idle time in queues and traffic jams, airplane rides
mercilessly kill time. Such periods can be filled with useful activities, such
as listening to educational courses or audiobooks, and creating a schedule for
the next day.

### Rule 8. Adherence to the "70 by 30" principle

A typical mistake of beginners learning time management is to plan the whole
time, while it is worthwhile to write down in the diary only about 70% of cases,
leaving a few hours for force majeure and other circumstances. In addition, the
remaining 30% of free time will save a person from the unpleasant feeling of
being a robot, the feeling of being imprisoned in rigid frameworks, will save
the nervous system from overwork and overload.

Also, when creating an individual schedule, it is very important to be realistic
about your own capabilities, not to overwhelm yourself with a huge number of
tasks. It's better to guarantee that you have time for a small number of
important things than to feel like a horse in the soap.

### Rule 9. Preparing the to-do list in advance

Evening to-do schedule for tomorrow is an opportunity not to miss anything in
the morning and afternoon hours of the next day. In this case, it is necessary
not only to write down the actual tasks, but also to set the degree of
importance for them, to distribute them into columns, so that first of all
attention is paid to global, not minor tasks.

### Rule 10. Putting everything back where it belongs

Searching for missing items inevitably wastes many times more time than putting
everything back in its place immediately after use. Organizing your workplace
also saves precious minutes during the day: it is therefore better to prepare a
special organizer for pens, a folder for papers, a drawer for documents or
receipts, etc. beforehand.

### Rule 11. Leading a healthy lifestyle

Good health, positive attitude, positive energy strongly influence the high
productivity of the manager, office worker and any other employee of the
company. Therefore, it is recommended that every person should regularly engage
in sports: fitness, swimming, yoga, running.

### Rule 12. Satisfaction with one's activities

Love for one's own activity is the best way of motivation and self-organization
for any specialist. Satisfaction with one's own work allows planning and
carrying out professional activities without feeling stressed and feeling
dissatisfied.

## Time planning methods

Most people are familiar with various time management methods. However, we will
consider the most effective and productive of them, which are suitable for every
manager during professional activities, regardless of the size of the company he
manages, the technology used and the number of subordinates.

### The "Alps" method

An effective technique that breaks down a large task into smaller ones,
following the principle of climbing a mountain step-by-step. It includes five
stages of planning:

1. Making a task list.

2. Estimating the length of time required to complete the tasks.

3. Allocating the right amount of time in the personal to-do schedule for each
   errand at a ratio of about 60% to 40%, where 40% is free time.

4. Create a step-by-step plan for accomplishing or delegating prioritized tasks
   with the duration of all steps.

5. Accounting for completed and uncompleted items in the plan.

The main problem with this method is that not every person has the ability to
predict the exact deadline for a particular task. Therefore, it is not
recommended to schedule all working hours. It is better to leave 40% of the
schedule for unforeseen circumstances and unplanned actions.

### Eisenhower matrix

A popular technique developed by one of the most productive and active U.S.
presidents, Dwight Eisenhower. He proposed to draw up a scheme according to
which all affairs should be scheduled in a table consisting of four groups:

1. **Important and urgent tasks**. Here you should specify the things that
   should never be postponed, since your future career directly depends on their
   precise fulfillment. For example, buying tickets for an important business
   trip, signing a contract with major customers or an urgent order.

2. **Important and non-urgent tasks**. These are tasks that you can take your
   time with, but your personal productivity and career advancement depend on
   them. For example, meeting new employees, checking repairs in the office,
   taking courses and trainings, attending events, learning foreign languages.

3. **Unimportant and urgent tasks**. Here, most often, we consider tasks that
   can and should be delegated and divided among subordinates or assistants to
   free up time to perform their own duties. For example, ordering stationery,
   sending invitation letters to partners, calling a master to fix the printer.

4. **Unimportant and non-urgent tasks**. These are tasks that are not useful for
   the company and professional activity. For example, personal conversations
   and meetings during work, browsing social networks.

Prioritizing with the help of a matrix allows you to pay attention to the most
global things, not to be distracted by unnecessary things. Also, all tasks are
written down in one place, will correspond to the conditions and order of
fulfillment for each group of the matrix, so nothing is lost or forgotten.

## Mistakes in executive time management

We have considered several useful techniques for time management of a manager,
which you can apply and try in your team, above. However, it is also worth
telling separately about the mistakes that can be encountered in time
management. The main mistake of managers in the distribution of working time is
that they try to exceed the plan and simultaneously solve several tasks at once.
Often this tactic leads to the opposite result: fatigue, working hard, failure
to meet deadlines for all projects, and force majeure.

Another example of a global time management blunder is not knowing how to use
secretaries, not understanding how to delegate responsibilities, the habit of
controlling everything, redoing things for employees, and giving out intrusive
work advice. To avoid this it is necessary to learn to trust other people, give
them more assignments, freeing up time for their own duties. Employees should
not always obey the manager, so it is necessary to build trusting relationships
to increase team communication and productivity.

Inadequate communication with subordinates is also a major mistake. To solve
this problem, the LeaderTask program is an excellent solution, with corporate
online chat, the ability to monitor and analyze the actions of each employee and
department.

## Example of a working day schedule

A manager can plan his day using a variety of methods. Here is a concrete
example of a successful daily schedule made with the help of the Eisenhower
matrix:

| Sector A. 08.00 - 08.30. Sales planner 08.50 - 09.00. Mail, answers to partners, clients 09.40 - 10.20. Purchase of tickets for business trip 16.00 - 17.00. Meeting with sponsors | Sector B. 10.30 - 11.20. Viewing the webinar from the training session 11.30 - 12.00. Getting acquainted with new office staff 12.20 - 12.40. Calling with business partners 13.30 - 14.30. Break, rest, lunch |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sector C. 13.00 - 13.30. Purchase of a new desk for the office 14.40 - 14.50. Viewing the new design on the website 14.50 - 15.00. Review comments on the website                  | Sector D. 1\. Watch social media. 2\. Watch news. 3\. Watch YouTube.                                                                                                                                           |

Completed to-do's should be color-coded or crossed off the plate.

Also, if necessary, you can choose another technique or schedule your working
day in a notebook-organizer, excel spreadsheet or use for this purpose the
LeaderTask application, which has a convenient executive calendar with a
schedule function.
