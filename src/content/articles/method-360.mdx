  degree assessment, how it helps in motivating

Every business manager periodically needs to conduct personnel assessment. For
this purpose, various methods and tools are used in practice. You can set
mandatory key indicators and monitor their fulfillment. Or you can rely on your
own subjective opinion. But, neither in the first nor in the second case it does
not reflect the full picture of the employee's effectiveness. A person can
masterfully cope with a given plan, but be completely unbearable in the team. A
person may periodically delay the delivery of his or her current part of the
work, but still manage to help colleagues in their competencies. The 360-degree
method is used to assess the suitability of personnel for their positions,
determine their potential, and make various managerial decisions regarding
bonuses, training, and transfers. How does it help to understand the
effectiveness of employees? Is it suitable for all companies? Let's tell you
more about this method in the review and try to figure it out.

## What is the essence of the method and how it works

The name 360 performance review is a way of assessing personnel performance,
built in the form of a survey of management and colleagues, which allows you to
accurately determine how well an employee meets certain competencies, identify
his or her characteristics, pros and cons. It is an easy way to see yourself
from the outside. To find out what your coworkers think of you. After all, we
often evaluate ourselves incorrectly, downplaying or exaggerating our
professional qualities and merits. For example, some people may think that
public speaking is their specialty, but in reality, it is not.

A 360-degree assessment helps performers objectively evaluate their strengths
and weaknesses. They can get a clear picture of where they should develop. This
technique is often used to eliminate conflicts in the team and prevent valuable
specialists from leaving the company. Its essence is as follows:

- The first step is to assemble a group of people who will be evaluating the
  professional.

- Explain the purpose of the questionnaire and the criteria to be followed in
  the evaluation.

- Hand out questionnaires, take a survey.

- At its end, it is summarized, conclusions are drawn, and stakeholders are
  told.

- Identify growth areas, create individualized business development plans for
  the employee.

A 360-degree 360-degree evaluation goes beyond analyzing performance. It is a
more holistic, multifaceted process. It is aimed at developing employees,
examining the quality of their work. This method should not be used to replace
regular staff appraisals. It is ideal to conduct these studies in a
comprehensive manner, taking into account actual performance, compliance with
job descriptions, behavior and interaction with other parties involved in the
work process.

## Pros and cons of the method

Using the rule of the 360 degree method for personnel evaluation, it is possible
to get a comprehensive picture of the activities and capabilities of each
employee. Other advantages of the methodology include:

- Identify growth points for the team and each team member.

- Effective assessment of soft skills - communication skills with others.

- No need to engage the services of external experts to conduct the study.
  Necessary information can be collected with the strength and experience of the
  HR department.

Since the survey is conducted anonymously, nothing will prevent other members of
the work team from objectively and honestly assessing the work of a colleague.
In addition, the use of 360-degree techniques contributes to better staff
development. Eliminates possible obstacles in teamwork. Forms a friendly and
comfortable working environment.

**There are disadvantages to this method of assessment as well:**

- It requires time to develop questionnaires, inform the participants, process
  and analyze the results.

- Limited to competencies, without taking into account the real achievements of
  the employee.

- Invariably accompanied by stress in the evaluated professional.

- Does not provide sufficient information to predict his future employment with
  the company.

- If the conditions of anonymity are not met, it can cause discord in the team.
  In addition, employees are not always candid when evaluating their supervisor
  and may focus mainly on negative aspects when describing colleagues.

The 360 degree technique is not the only method of evaluating personnel when
dealing with employee promotions or terminations.

## When to use this technique

![When to use 360 technique](/method360-1024x376.webp)

The main purpose of HR analytics is to study the different qualities of
employees depending on their career, functions and company needs. Surveys are
usually based on communication skills and abilities needed in a particular
workplace. In the process of questionnaires, the following are investigated:

- Ability to communicate with other participants in the work process (listening
  and hearing skills, manner of speech, non-verbal behavior).

- Interpersonal skills (positive attitude, courteous communication, negotiation
  skills).

- Organized (logical thinking, planning, attention to detail).

- Creative capabilities (creative approach to solving difficult situations).

- Leadership skills (ability to lead, decision-making responsibility,
  delegation).

- Strategic vision (understanding of values, enterprise mission, long-term
  planning).

- Customer success (sales skills, consideration of customer opinions and
  wishes).

- Management capabilities (staff organization, responsibility for the team,
  interaction with colleagues).

When assessing the head of a department or subdivision, the questionnaire will
be dominated by questions related to leadership, managerial competencies. The
questionnaire will also contain information related to his/her loyalty to
subordinates, ability to show empathy.

**A 360 assessment is appropriate:**

- As a powerful motivational factor contributing to the development of a person
  as a person and a specialist in his/her environment. It perfectly stimulates
  to work on one's "weaknesses". Needed to take a sober look at oneself from the
  outside.

- To form a personnel reserve. Using this method, you can find out which
  performers will be able to work effectively in a team when launching new
  projects. Which of them can apply for management positions. Who is able to
  "pull" the company in difficult or critical situations.

- Assessments of the company's management model. Based on the anonymous survey
  of subordinates, conclusions can be drawn about the need to adjust the
  management style in the company.

- Plan employee training and development. Using information from surveys,
  develop a training program for the staff. Select courses and trainings to be
  attended by the company's specialists.

- Increasing the self-esteem of employees. Sometimes competent specialists are
  afraid to take on the responsibility of project management because they think
  they do not have enough leadership skills to do so. Peer debriefing helps such
  employees to gain self-confidence and not to doubt their abilities.

If there are no competencies for the position under study, no clear patterns of
behavior of importance to the company, it is not reasonable to spend time and
resources on a 360 assessment.

## Conditions required for a 360 degree assessment

When choosing this method of HR-analytics, it is important to choose the right
assessment focus. Unlike the assessment methodology, which is a psychological
portrait of an individual, the 360 technique allows you to assess the behavior
of an employee in specific work situations through the eyes of his colleagues,
supervisor, and subordinates who encounter him at work on a daily basis.

But in order for the assessment to be true and objective, in addition to the
internal readiness of the team, it is important to comply with a number of
conditions in the organization itself. These include:

- Low staff turnover. Employees who have worked together for less than a year
  can hardly be expected to provide truthful information regarding the
  abilities, qualifications and personal qualities of their colleagues. Their
  circle of communication is limited to the work environment. They have not had
  the opportunity to get to know each other better in informal situations.
  Therefore, the picture will be incomplete and biased.

- Flexible company management style. In an authoritarian regime, employees will
  not be frank for fear of subsequent sanctions and repressive measures.
  Especially if they have to evaluate their immediate supervisor. Or they may
  use questionnaires for "revenge" against undesirable colleagues.

- Lack of established interest groups in the team. In this case, interested
  parties will easily agree to act on the principle of "you to me - I to you"
  during the survey, which will reduce its effectiveness and objectivity to
  zero.

- "A healthy psychological and working environment". If a company practices
  nepotism, "sucking up" to colleagues to advance in their careers, the 360
  methodology will do more harm than good. Since it will turn from an effective
  way to develop the organization into just another way to "eliminate"
  inconvenient people or bring closer the "acceptable" ones.

The methodology will be effective in companies with a democratic management
style, practicing the development of teamwork, with a well-formed corporate
culture.

## What you need for a 360-degree assessment

![What you need for a 360-degree assessment](/level-360-method-1024x372.webp)

First of all, they determine what qualities, skills, abilities are important in
an employee. They represent a model of competencies. For example, for a sales
specialist, it is important to be able to communicate with customers, listen,
quickly make balanced and rational decisions. The competencies of a secretary
include attentiveness, thoroughness, ability to multitask, friendliness,
personal charm and ability to interact with others. Employees who have been with
the company for at least six months are evaluated using the 360 degree method.

After the competency model is approved, the survey participants are informed
about the purpose, progress and nature of the survey. They should understand
that this method of assessment is aimed at the development of the employee,
obtaining possible prospects in the company. They should be informed that the
survey will be anonymous.

Next, a list of questionnaire questions is developed. The questionnaire consists
of two parts. One of them contains the questions themselves, and in the other
part the participants of the study put scores. Two scales can be used for
evaluation: indicator and level scales. An example of indicator scoring is given
in the table below:

| Indicator |                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 0   | Any goals are missing, achieving a reduction in the amount of work.                                        |
| Level 0,5 | When setting goals from superiors, strive to adjust them downward.                                         |
| Level 1   | Fulfills leadership objectives but gravitates toward simple, easily attainable goals.                      |
| Level 1,5 | Sets specific goals to work towards.                                                                       |
| Level 2   | Ready for active independent work, makes efforts to realize challenging goals.                             |
| Level 2,5 | Achieves serious results and continually raises the bar by setting the "tone" of work for other employees. |

The level evaluation of personnel is as follows:

Work for a common result, attitude towards common interests is evaluated.

1. Manifests itself on a regular basis, without exception.

2. Observed daily, but there are exceptions.

3. Two or three times in the last quarter.

4. No more than twice in the same period.

5. Does not show interest in the company, such actions are absent.

After compiling the questionnaires and approving their form, select a platform
for conducting the research, taking into account confidentiality, secure access
to information, round-the-clock technical support and the possibility of
uploading reports for the customer. Inform all survey participants about the
survey.

Ensure complete confidentiality of the study. You can do this in one of the
following ways:

- "Closed boxes for questionnaires". It is used when completing a paper-based
  questionnaire. This method is not very convenient as it covers colleagues
  exclusively from the employee's immediate environment.

- One-time email accounts on popular portals (yahoo mail or gmail.com). But, in
  this case all results will have to be processed manually.

- Online assessment in automatic mode with the involvement of special services
  saves time and money of the company. Ensures complete anonymity and trust on
  the part of the interviewees.

After data collection, analyze the information obtained and provide feedback,
communicating the importance of the findings to employees. Provide detailed
recommendations for improvement and development with the selection of individual
training programs.

## Evaluating employee performance with LeaderTask

![LeaderTask](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

The modern digital application LeaderTask can help you evaluate the efficiency
of each employee or the staff as a whole. The program keeps detailed statistics
on employee activity with analytical reports on their workload, efficiency and
functionality.

The online application provides the manager with constant communication with
employees, provides an opportunity to delegate tasks with subsequent control
over the degree of their fulfillment. He can visually assess what work has been
done, what needs to be completed by the near future, and what processes are
still "hanging in the air".

Thanks to the visual display of employment, productivity and successes of
performers working on a common project, all team members have an excellent
incentive to "reach for" the best indicators in order not to be in the lagging
link. Any questions about the project can be discussed in a convenient corporate
chat room.

In the program it is convenient to create tasks and assignments for yourself and
your colleagues, to control their execution, to make corrections, to send them
for revision. You can check the progress of tasks realization by the tags:
"Ready for delivery", "Unread", etc.

The functionality of the online service includes many options useful for the
manager and executor, including: an order execution control program, an
organizer, a kanban board, and a task scheduler. The application is compatible
with any digital platforms. It works efficiently in offline mode, without
internet.

## Conclusion

360 degrees is an effective method of employee assessment and development,
suitable for companies with a stable headcount, developed corporate culture and
open relationships in the team. It should not be used for the distribution of
bonuses, during instability or crisis of the company. It is also not suitable
for assessing employees with less than six months of service.

Before conducting the survey, it is important to convey to all participants of
the event the need for evaluation, the criteria by which it will be carried out,
its scale, and objectives. The best platform for the survey would be a
specialized digital service.

The study should end with a mandatory meeting with the evaluated employee.
During this meeting, the results are discussed and an individual development
plan program is selected.
