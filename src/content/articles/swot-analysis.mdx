Before implementing business ideas "for a million" it is necessary to assess the
strengths and weaknesses of a future product or service, to develop a strategy
for its promotion in the market, taking into account competition and associated
risks. For this purpose, SWOT analysis is used - an analytical method that
evaluates all direct and indirect factors affecting the business. With its help
you can analyze anything: from a new product, released on the market, marketing
plan, to your own health, achievements or career prospects. We would like to
tell you more about SWOT analysis in this article.

## What it is: essence, deciphering

![What is SWOT](/swot-1024x532-1.webp)

SWOT analysis is one of the methods of strategic planning, used to assess the
strengths, weaknesses of the firm, its competitiveness, taking into account all
external and internal threats. The name of SWOT analysis methodology is
deciphered by letters in this way: S - Strengths, W - Weakness, O -
Opportunities, T - Threats, where:

- Strengths, refers to the strengths of the organization

- Weakness, are called weaknesses

- Opportunities, refers to environmental factors

- Threats, company threats

The concept of SWOT-analysis was first announced in 1963, at an international
conference in Harvard, by Professor Kenneth Andrews, and began to be used by
companies for strategic planning.

The matrix consists of four segments, each of which is significant within the
definition of factors and has an impact on the firm's operations:

| Strengths     | S   | These are internal factors that provide advantages of the organization in the market, distinguishing its products and dignity against the background of competitors. For example: the right marketing model, beautiful product packaging, extended service. |
| ------------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Weaknesses    | W   | These include aspects of the firm's activities that need to be changed or improved, which may lead to a decrease in competitiveness or sales. For example: poor quality service.                                                                            |
| Opportunities | O   | These are external factors, signs, events in the market, in the economic life of the country, which can further positively affect the development of the company. For example: reduction of the customs duty rate, emergence of new technologies.           |
| Threats       | T   | Unfavorable risk events that lead to business problems. Example: tax increases.                                                                                                                                                                             |

The object of analytics can be the company itself, its departments, brand, sales
force, individual business elements, products, services, or even individuals.

## What it's used for

![What swot used for](/dlya-chego-swot-1024x682-1.webp)

Why use a SWOT analysis? The main purpose of SWOT analysis involves building a
strategy for an enterprise or project, taking into account all categories of
factors affecting it. In the process of practical research swot analysis
identifies the competitive advantages of the company, assesses the state of the
external environment, selects the most effective methods of its development,
helps to identify the weak components of the business system. Application of
swot analysis in practice will suit both companies with a long history of
activity (to develop an algorithm of anti-crisis measures, update the form of
strategy), and start-ups for the successful launch of the product, ahead of
competitors, to deploy the structure of the team. SWOT analysis helps:

- Quickly adapt to changes. Assessing the prospects of a product or service in
  the market, the company quickly adapts to the trends and requirements of the
  industry at the right time, forming a properly designed unique selling
  proposition.

- The analysis of the results of activities for a certain period of time. Swot
  analysis allows you to look at the growth of the company, shows improvements
  in performance parameters, and also includes new threats to the business that
  have emerged over time.

- Anticipate and assess risks when launching a new product. To get outstanding
  results, you need to do what others are not doing. But how to understand which
  product will bring real profit and which will fail miserably? That is what
  swot analysis is for.

- Consider and timely identify external and internal threats and challenges, and
  make necessary amendments to the strategy. To outline growth points for
  gaining advantages over competitors. Compare the growth scheme with
  competitors.

- The need to allocate resources to address an illiquid product or service that
  is not generating revenue. For example: customers choose another company's
  products because the technical support service does not process their requests
  in a timely manner. In the process of SWOT analysis the work of employees is
  studied, ways of making decisions about possible personnel changes or
  automation of customer service processes are taken.

Swot analysis is used to identify advantages and "bottlenecks" in the company's
activities. The degree of influence of the external environment on it is
determined. With the help of swot analysis it is clarified how it is possible to
use its strengths to resist existing and emerging threats. The extent to which
the company's weaknesses affect its development and position in the industry.

## Advantages and disadvantages

SWOT analysis does not require specific knowledge or analytical expertise.
However, this simple theory has its own pitfalls. The effectiveness of the
research depends on the integrity and responsibility of all its participants.
That is, the method has pros and cons:

| Advantages                                                                                                                                                    | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Versatility**: It can be used to research an entire country, company or part of a country.                                                                  | **Subjectivity of the assessment**: The methodology covers the opinions of the people conducting it, who may have different perceptions of the company's strengths or weaknesses.                          |
| **Easy**. No training is required to use the technique.                                                                                                       | **Difficulty in interpreting results**. Due to the lack of universal instructions and clear criteria for evaluation.                                                                                       |
| **Comprehensive approach**: external, internal factors affecting the business are considered.                                                                 | **Limitation by four groups of factors**. There are times when a more detailed breakdown of benefits or threats is necessary.                                                                              |
| **Valid assessment**: This report combines facts with a subjective assessment. On their basis it is possible to design an effective strategy for any company. | **The SWOT matrix reflects the firm's activities** "here and now", without affecting events that may occur after the study. Therefore, to keep the data up-to-date, the analysis should be done regularly. |
| **Use in the long or short term**. SWOT analysis can be used to develop operational activities or to make strategic plans for a remote period.                | **Lack of quantitative indicators.**                                                                                                                                                                       |

SWOT analysis allows the management and owners of a company to understandably
look at their business from different angles. But it does not provide a
description of precise numerical estimates and does not take time into account.
The data you get today may be very different from next year's results.

## How SWOT analysis is conducted

![How SWOT analysis is conducted](/kak-provoditsya-swot-1024x682-1.webp)

In order to get correct information that will really benefit the company, the
following tips and rules should be followed when performing swot analysis:

- Utilize proven information and principles.

- Avoid subjective evaluations.

- Examine only the essential and important issues.

- Create a table that is concise and informative.

To begin with, the composition of the group of participants is approved. It
includes specialists who are well oriented in the characteristics and features
of the service or product, who have information about the current situation in
the market. The total number of participants in swot analysis usually does not
exceed 7 people, as large teams are more difficult to manage. Before the
meeting, each of them receives a letter describing the format of the meeting,
the essence of the method to be used and a list of data to be prepared for the
study. This is especially important if this is the first time the SWOT matrix is
being prepared. The optimal duration of a SWOT analysis meeting is 1.5 hours.

Next:

Concludes with a list of questions. They are asked separately for each cell. For
example, the table could look like this:

| S                                          | W                                             | O                                                             | T                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Our competitive advantage?                 | What are our "weaknesses"?                    | How are market trends affecting the company?                  | What do our competitors represent?               |
| What do we do better than anyone else?     | What are we doing worse than the competition? | What can we learn for the company in this economic situation? | Which one of them is a threat to us?             |
| What resources do we have at our disposal? | What are our customers complaining about?     | What additional resources are provided to us?                 | How sustainable is our position in the industry? |
| What do customers like about us?           | What can we improve on in our work?           | What opportunities are opening up?                            | How does the cost of our products change?        |
| What assets does the company have?         |                                               | What are our chances for additional funding?                  | How reliable are our suppliers?                  |

1\. Lists can be written indefinitely. Each of them is assigned a priority.
Blocks of low-priority questions are left "until next time". When doing a SWOT
analysis, follow the Pareto technique: if you answer 20% of the questions on the
list, you will get 80% of the data.

2\. The focus group answers the questions, records the results. For each
individual quadrant of the diagram their own conclusion is formulated.

3\. Based on the analytical data, the company's strategic policy is developed.
All possible pairwise combinations from the matrix are taken into account. At
this stage it is worth writing strategies based on pairwise combinations:

- opportunities + strong traits;

- opportunities + weaknesses;

- threats + strong traits;

- threats + weaknesses.

It is better to start filling in the table with the strengths. Then you can edit
it and move on to discussing problem areas in the company's work, trying to be
as objective and honest in the assessment as possible. This will help to quickly
identify shortcomings, making an effective plan for their elimination. When
launching a new product or service, research participants should have an idea of
the needs and preferences of their target audience, and be aware of what is
going on with competitors.

## How to work with the results

After completing the SWOT matrix and writing the conclusions, an action plan is
drawn up. The following questions can be used to summarize the findings:

- **Analysis Question 1**. What product strengths should be emphasized when
  communicating with customers?

- **Analysis Question 2**. What positive characteristics need to be reinforced
  and developed?

- **Analysis Question 3**. What does the company or product need at this stage?
  How can it be obtained?

- **Analysis Question 4**. What should be done to eliminate bottlenecks?

- **Analysis Question 5**. What threats can the company be fully protected from
  or their occurrence minimized?

Two methods are used to evaluate the research result of SWOT analysis:

- Participants in the analysis assign points to each item, depending on its
  importance to the company. For example, from 1 to 5. Items with a score of 5
  are important at the moment, they will benefit the business in the future and
  are in line with the strategy approved earlier. Actions with a score of 1 are
  no longer relevant to the company.

- Swot analysis is used to assess the significance and probability of events.
  Significance is the importance and is evaluated on a five-point system. 5 is
  very important, 1 is not important. Probability in swot analysis shows whether
  the event is likely to occur in the near future, for example, within a month.

Based on the results of the SWOT analysis, the company's strategy is developed.

## Example of SWOT analysis

An example SWOT analysis can be done for any company, in this case let's look at
an example of an analysis that can be done for a cafe:

Strengths when analyzed:

1. Unique menu and quality culinary delights

2. Cozy atmosphere and friendly staff

3. Attractive location and high level of footfall

Weaknesses in the analysis:

1. Limited space and limited seating capacity

2. Lack of variety of services and lack of recreational activities

3. Failure to attract new customers and retain regular customers

Opportunities when analyzing:

1. Expanding the menu and adding new food categories

2. Development of loyalty programs for regular customers and promotions to
   attract new ones

3. Organization of thematic evenings and master classes to increase
   attractiveness

Threats in the analysis:

1. Competition from other cafes and restaurants in the area

2. Deterioration of the economic situation in the country and a decrease in
   consumer demand

3. Changes in legislation and increased tax burden on public catering
   enterprises
