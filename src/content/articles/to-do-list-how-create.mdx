There is a lot of information online about how to properly organize yourself and
become successful. Almost all experts recommend starting the process of
self-organization by creating a to-do list. This is the main tool of time
management, always working effectively, which has earned recognition in most
countries of the world. The popularity of this method of planning is due to its
simplicity and accessibility. To make a list of planned cases, all you need is a
pen and a sheet of paper. As a result, you will learn to allocate your time
wisely, become more successful and effective in work and personal life. Where to
start your list and how to follow it? Let's try to figure it out.

## Why it doesn't always work

Each of us at least once in our life tried to use this kind of planning and make
a to-do list. But, not all of its items have been achieved. As a rule, 40% of
the planned tasks remain unfinished, half of them are accomplished to the end
within one day, and 18% of them - within an hour. 10% are accomplished in a few
minutes.

To make your list really work, you should include only those things that you can
do during the day. It is not necessary to allocate time for general cleaning of
the house in a busy schedule. In any case, this task will not be completed
because you simply do not have enough time for it.

When making your to-do list for the day, analyze your productivity beforehand.
Keep track of how long it usually takes you to complete certain tasks. Check how
long you spend preparing for meetings, how much time you spend on business
correspondence. Based on your observations, it will be easier to create a plan
that actually works.

## Where to start making a list

First of all, you should decide on the right time for planning. Some people find
it more convenient to set themselves tasks in the morning. Others prefer to make
a plan for tomorrow from the evening. Each of these approaches has advantages
and disadvantages:

- A morning to-do list will be more accurate, as it will be easier to manage and
  can be added to as you go along. Starting the day with planning makes it
  easier to set yourself up to accomplish important tasks.

- A list for tomorrow, made in the evening, will help to systematize the
  information received during the day, to summarize the intermediate results for
  decision-making. Using this method, you will not have to be distracted from
  your main work in the morning to set daily tasks. You can start solving them
  right away.

You should choose the right time to plan based on your own schedule and
individual preferences. In some cases, it is more convenient to combine both
approaches to increase efficiency. In the evening to analyze the work done, and
in the morning to adjust the list as necessary.

## How to make a to-do list to help improve performance

![To-do lists](/spisok-del2-1024x583.webp)

A properly made plan for a day, week, month or year will help to achieve success
in many areas of life. It is enough to systematically fulfill its each point,
taking into account the state of health, external conditions, self-discipline
and other things. He will help to rationally distribute forces and resources to
achieve the set goals. Let's understand how to make the to-do list realistic and
correct.

### 1\. Remove unnecessary

When making a to-do list for the day, include only what you want and can
accomplish in that time. Do not add insignificant or minor tasks to it. The
longer your list is, the harder it will be to accomplish the items on it. This
will cause anxiety, irritability due to the inability to control the situation,
and, subsequently, may lead to health problems.

### 2\. Start with the main

When making your task list with a goal, put the most important thing at the
beginning. Start completing the items with these important things. If something
changes, if there are force majeure circumstances, at least you will be sure
that you have solved the key tasks. Smaller tasks can be postponed until
tomorrow.

### 3\. Keep it handy at all times

Having written down the planned tasks in an electronic diary or diary, some
people successfully put them "on the far shelf" and try to perform the tasks by
memory. Because of this, it ceases to be effective.

Keeping the list handy makes it easier to keep track of which tasks have been
completed and which ones need to be completed. In addition, it can be a good
incentive to work. Seeing it in front of our eyes always reminds us that we have
unfinished business. So let's not get distracted by talking on the phone, social
media content or watching TV shows.

### 4\. Limit each task to a time frame

A person is capable of accomplishing any task in the time he has at his
disposal. That is, you can spend the whole working day on one and the same
thing, or a couple of minutes allocated in a busy work schedule. Therefore, when
planning, it is better to set yourself a tight deadline. The more free time you
have, the less guarantee that you will finish the planned tasks on time. If your
tasks will be daily rewritten for the next day, such planning cannot be called
effective.

### 5\. Remove completed tasks from the list

They are erased, crossed out, marked with crosses or check marks, or any other
way to mark the completion of a planned task. This way you won't be distracted
by completed tasks. In addition, the items crossed off the list will be a kind
of confirmation of your progress. By evening, you will be able to tell yourself
with full confidence that the day was not in vain.

### 6\. Turn list making into a habit

For this method of planning to be successful and effective, it must be used
regularly. Making daily to-do lists should become a useful habit, which will
help to put your personal and work affairs in order and make your life organized
and stable. At first it may happen that you will forget to cross off completed
items from the list, or forget about its existence because of minor household
chores. But, over time, your brain will get used to the new way of thinking.

### 7\. Set realistic and achievable goals for yourself

Take a few minutes to describe the task in detail. Vague, unspecific wording
will not make you want to take action immediately. Therefore, write clearly,
briefly, and to the point.

### 8\. Use correct wording

The way in which the essence of the task is written down in the list determines
the efficiency and quality of its execution. To make a task in the plan
"workable" and "correct", it must meet the following criteria:

- Start with a verb in the imperative mood. In the grocery list, you should
  write "Buy milk", not "Milk".

- Specify a specific outcome: "Write a 10-page outline" instead of: "Write an
  outline".

- Imply specific steps in implementing the plan. It is not necessary to write in
  the first paragraph: "Start general cleaning". More correct would be the text:
  "Buy detergents for general cleaning".

### 9\. Separate tasks with strict deadlines and more flexible tasks from each other

Flexible activities are those that can be done at any time of the day. These
include watering flowers, writing an article, fixing a broken iron, etc. Tasks
with rigid limits must be completed in a limited amount of time. For example:
picking up your child from kindergarten at 17.00-17.30, taking a bus at 12.20,
etc.

In the to-do list, it is better to record such tasks in separate columns:

| 9.00 - Project Meeting                                               | Analyze statistics on the June report                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11.00 - Discussing the implementation of the new CRM with colleagues | Check the shipment of goods to other country                     |
| 17.00 - Attend a fitness training session                            | Make a report on the promotional campaign                        |
| 21.00 - Watch the family movie "The Lion King" with a child          | Check the prices on the website to make sure they are up to date |
|                                                                      | Buy groceries for a weekend get-together with friends            |

### 10\. Divide tasks into major and minor tasks

If you have too many tasks on your list and you're in a slight panic because you
don't have enough time to complete them, divide all the items on your list into
three categories:

- Things to be sure to complete today.

- Tasks that are desirable to complete by the end of the day.

- Things that can be delayed a bit without compromising your personal life or
  workflow.

Grouping tasks by activity and location will help you get through them more
quickly.

## Task list options

![Task list options](/varianty-spiska-del-1024x323.webp)

There are many ways to do daily planning. The easiest way is to take a piece of
paper, a pen and write down all your planned activities in any order. This work
will not take you much time. But, a list made by one of the following methods
will be more effective:

### The Schwab method

Its essence is to assign numbers to tasks in the order of their priority and
importance. The tasks are started from the first item.

### The method of three results

Identify three outcomes related to life goals that need to be achieved in a set
amount of time. For example: Enroll in a Chinese course (goal: learn Chinese).
Prepare for a presentation (goal: career). Find hosting for a website (goal: to
open an online store). Other things in the plan are done as needed.

### Methodology 1-3-5

It consists of scheduling no more than 9 cases at a time:

- One major task;

- Three medium-priority assignments;

- Five minor cases.

First perform the tasks from the first and second groups. Then they move on to
the secondary ones.

### Eisenhower matrix

A universal planning method that involves categorizing tasks by urgency and
importance. They are divided into four groups:

- A – urgent and important (go to the doctor).

- B – important but not urgent (enroll in IT courses).

- C – not important but urgent (a haircut at the barbershop).

- D – not urgent or important (go to the movies).

The execution starts with items A and C. Then come cases from category B and D.

### The Pomodoro method

Offers a distinctive approach to organizing and managing tasks. It works like
this:

1. You need to select any of the tasks from the list.

2. Set a timer on your phone or other digital device for 25 minutes. During this
   period of time, you should work on the selected task.

3. After the end of the allotted timing, the task is marked with a cross and a
   five-minute break is taken.

4. Then go back to solving the task by setting the timer for 25 minutes. Repeat
   the described manipulations until the task is completed.

### The Alpen way

It consists of five main stages:

1. A list of tasks is compiled.

2. It is estimated how much time is needed to solve each of them.

3. It is calculated how much time is available with a margin of 40%.

4. The list is customized to fit the time allotted.

5. The results of the day are summarized. Uncompleted tasks are carried over to
   the next day.

This method is suitable for people who are chronically pressed for time.

## Applications and programs for planning

In today's environment, making to-do lists on sheets of paper or in paper
diaries seems like a "stone age". Most specialists working in the field of time
management prefer to use special services for planning that combine the
functions of an electronic secretary and a task planner.
