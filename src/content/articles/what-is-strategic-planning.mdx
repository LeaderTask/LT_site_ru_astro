Strategic planning is a structure, scheme or a set of management methods and
tools for determining the main directions of the organization's activities. Such
planning is used for forecasting, formation of indicators of the company's
development, determination of its purpose in the market, prospects and success

allows correct assessment of external threats to the company, search for
potential opportunities for development based on the analysis performed. The
result of the process is a strategic plan it's a document describing strategic
and tactical goals supported by calculations and practical research. Strategic
plans are made for a long-term period (from three to five years), medium-term
period (annual), there is also a composite short-term plan (less than a year).
They are united by the combination of a common business idea and the management
will of the owners of the organization.

participants in the work process. No matter how concrete and clearly formulated
plans may seem in the heads of managers, they must be recorded and communicated
in writing to subordinates to avoid incorrect interpretation or double
interpretation. In this way, a number of misunderstandings are avoided, and
coherence and accountability of the actions of managers and staff are ensured.

## Stages of strategic planning

![Stages of strategic planning](/strategica-planirovs-1024x372.webp)

Strategic planning is a multi-step management process consisting of several
steps. These steps include:

- Formation of mission, key objectives;

- Strategic Analysis;

- Choosing a strategy;

- Realization;

- Evaluation and control of its execution.

### Defining the mission, key objectives

The mission of the company forms its purpose, philosophy, direction of activity.
It affects the principles of the company's work, its status, basic business
characteristics. Shapes the image of the company, reflects its values. Helps in
the development of corporate standards. Provides the relationship of the
organization with the external environment: population, economy, political
system.

The mission lays down the vector of the company's future development. It
demonstrates the direction in which efforts should be directed. It does not
depend on the financial stability and state of the enterprise at a given time.
Despite the fact that the reason for the existence of commercial organizations
is to make profit, their mission should pursue other goals.

The purpose of strategic planning is a detailed description of the company's
mission. It creates clear guidelines for its development for a certain time
interval. Be specific, commensurate, not contradictory to the mission and
resources available to the company. To be targeted and controlled. It is
necessary for planning not to be "detached" from real life.

## Strategic analysis

![Strategic analysis](/strat-analysys-1024x372.webp)

Includes a detailed study of the external, internal environment in which the
company operates. The external environment is formed by the following factors:

- The economic situation of the region or country;

- Regulatory and legal requirements for carrying out this type of activity;

- Political, societal, socio-cultural influences on the market;

- Consumer needs and preferences, market rules.

Internal analysis is done with consideration:

- The quality of its own products and services;

- Estimates of the market segment occupied by the company;

- Realizable pricing policy;

- Effectiveness of advertising activities;

- Resources used, costs of production;

- Optimization options.

Strategic plans are drawn up on the basis of actual data containing detailed
information on market conditions, customers, competitors. They are made on the
basis of two-dimensional matrices that help to analyze the work of departments,
product quality, production status by various criteria.

There are three approaches used to implement strategic analysis:

1. One of the approaches is tabular, in which the values of the studied
   parameters are arranged in ascending order as they move away from the graph.
   The analysis is performed diagonally, from the upper left corner to the lower
   right corner.

2. Coordinate, where values increase as they move away from the center of
   intersection of coordinate lines. The analysis is performed from the lower
   left to the upper right indicator.

3. Logical. In this case, a brief analysis is performed from the lower right to
   the upper left corner.

### Strategy selection

Strategy indicates the way to achieve the goal. It determines the course of
development for a long period of time. Affects all areas of the company's
activities, including the form of production, personnel, and market position.
When developing a strategy, several options are considered and the best one is
chosen. The following points are taken into account:

- Competing environment;

- Prospects for the development of the sphere in which the organization
  operates;

- The technology at disposal.

The strategy must lead to the achievement of the ultimate goal. By choosing a
strategy of development and staying on the market, the company moves in the
right direction. In a simplified form, the options of strategic development can
be as follows:

- Limiting growth. It is considered the safest way of doing business. Approved
  indicators are used as a benchmark for development in this case. For example,
  sales plans based on the plans of previous periods.

- Free growth is accompanied by a gradual increase in the set indicators to be
  achieved in the short and long term. This type of development is suitable for
  young companies starting out in free market niches. They grow by increasing
  their product range or opening new outlets in different cities.

- Reduction due to a decrease in performance. This occurs when a business is
  liquidated, unprofitable or unprofitable trading facilities are closed,
  production is reduced due to economic crises or business priorities are
  changed.

Downsizing involves three scenarios:

- The first is liquidation, with a complete sale of the company's assets and
  inventory;

- The second is to cut off the unnecessary (units or activities);

- The third is reorientation (partial reduction of activities to increase
  profits).

These strategies can be used individually or in combination.

### Strategy implementation

All employees are involved in the implementation of the strategy. Each of them
performs their own functions and tasks to achieve the desired result. For
successful implementation of the strategy, the following conditions must be met:

- Communicate to each employee the content of the company's mission, goals, and
  strategy to achieve their understanding of the management's actions, and to
  involve them in the process of realizing the goals.

- Ensure that all required resources are available in a timely manner.

- To form target settings for movement on the intended plan.

- Responsibly complete tasks at every level.

At this stage, the most important guidelines of strategic planning are
developed: tactics, policies, procedures and rules of the company's existence.

### Evaluation and monitoring of implementation

This is the final stage of strategic planning, which compares projected and
achieved results with an assessment of profitability. The purpose of the
assessment is to get answers to the following questions:

- To what extent is the strategy aligned with the company's capabilities?

- Are the perceived threats and risks embedded in it?

- Does the enterprise have enough resources for its realization?

- Does it take into account the external, internal environment?

- Is the chosen strategic path the best use of the company's resources?

Quantitative and qualitative criteria are used to evaluate and analyze the
strategy.
