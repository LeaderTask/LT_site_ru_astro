  methods and technologies. Distinguishing a goal from a task.

The first step in developing any project is proper goal setting. This action
determines what result the team wants to achieve. Goal setting creates an image
of the desired future. Project goals answer the question, "What should the team
get at the end of the project?" Each goal has a set of objectives: actions to be
performed to achieve the planned result. Their formulation starts with an action
verb: to develop, to do, to conduct, to organize, and so on. This will make them
measurable and controllable.

When referring to the concepts of "project goals and objectives", we often
identify them as synonyms. But, in fact, these are different categories in
meaning and content, which require separate analysis and study. How do they
differ from each other? How to learn how to formulate and control them
correctly? Let us consider these and other questions in more detail.

## How project goals and objectives differ

In project management, a project goal is a set of outcomes that a company seeks
to achieve. A precise description of the outcome of joint activities. Solution
of a real existing, actual problem. Goals are expressed in qualitative or
quantitative form. They describe what will happen when the project is completed.

Project objectives clarify the formulation of the result. They are a kind of
checkpoints, which can be used to guide the achievement of the intended goals.
They describe ways of solving the problem. The final result depends on their
correctness. But, at the same time, goals are more important than objectives.
They can be broader and more abstract, while objectives are always concrete
steps on the way to the result.

_Goal: Organize effective feedback between developers and clients._

_Objective within this goal: Add five new feedback form options to the site
within the next two months._

## How to set the right project goals

Key issues in formulating the project's purpose:

1. What needs to be done, why?

2. How should this be accomplished?

3. Why does it really matter?

4. To what extent do all participants understand the essence of the project?

5. Does anyone have any objections to the execution?

6. When do I need to complete the work?

7. Who will control the quality? By what criteria?

8. What resources and facilities are available to the company to accomplish the
   project?

9. What characteristics should the final product have?

10. What should not happen under any circumstances?

The answers to these questions will be the project objectives. There are five
criteria that must be met in order to formulate them correctly:

- **Costs**. During the planning stage, project costs are analyzed. The extent
  to which the profit from realization will exceed the cost of production is
  specified. It is important to clearly understand how much it will cost to
  implement it. If the project is initially recognized as unprofitable, it is
  abandoned at this stage.

- **Work deadlines**. These are approved before the tasks are started. The team
  should know how long it will take to reach the final point.

- **Responsibilities**. The progress of execution is supervised by an authorized
  employee. His duties include control over the work of each performer at each
  stage. He is directly responsible for its fulfillment or non-fulfillment.

- **Specificity in the construction of goals**. They must be understandable to
  every performer. Measurable and realistic. This will help to choose the right
  resources and means necessary to achieve them.

- **Achievability**. You should not set goals for your team that they cannot
  achieve. Otherwise, employees' efforts will be wasted. They will not take the
  initiative in solving important tasks. They will work without any dedication,
  "on the back-burner".

Having approved the goals of the project, we move on to setting objectives. The
understanding of the final result depends on their clarity and formulation. The
project is structured. It is easier to control and manage it at each stage.

Next, a project plan is prepared. It specifies additional elements affecting the
project: lists of stakeholders, timeline, forecast of expected results and other
data. The plan describes the actions to be taken when the project conditions
change. It helps prevent project failure due to external and internal factors.

Objectives are formulated before the plan is written. Many items, including
performance and success indicators, depend on how they are interpreted.

### Formulation of SMART goals

![SMART goals](/smart-goals-1024x372.webp)

The formulation of project objectives is done in various ways. For example,
using the SMART method. According to this methodology, they should be specific,
measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound. SMART-technologies help to
develop the most transparent and realistic key project goals and objectives.
Examples of using this method in practice are presented in the following table:

|            |                                                                                                                     | Examples                                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Specific   | When setting goals, the specifics of the organization are taken into account.                                       | What do we need? What do we get as a result? What result do we need to achieve?        | Increase in sales volume.Development of the market segment in a new region.Increase in the client base of the company. |
| Measurable | They should have developed clear criteria for measurement.                                                          | What results do we need to achieve in quantitative terms? What profit will we get?     | Increase in sales by 20%.500,000 rubles or other amount.                                                               |
| Achievable | When embarking on a project, those involved in the process must be confident in their ability to execute.           | Is this goal realistically achievable? How quickly can the planned result be achieved? | Competitive Advantage Analysis.                                                                                        |
| Relevant   | The project objective should be relevant to the core business. Not contradict other objectives of the organization. | Why do we need it? How well does the result match the company's values and strategy?   | Work with customer base to incentivize repeat purchase of products.                                                    |
| Time bound | The timing of goals should be dictated by the real needs of the company.                                            | In how much time do you need to get results?                                           | Year, month, specific date.                                                                                            |

The more transparent the goals are, the easier they are to achieve. They should
be flexible and changeable enough. In the course of the project, new
circumstances may arise that were not taken into account at the initial levels.
To minimize the risk of project failure or stoppage, a study of opportunities
and threats is conducted at the planning stage.

### Risk and threat analysis

A feasibility check is performed to clarify the feasibility of the project and
its benefits to the company. In doing so, attention is paid to the following
aspects:

- **Financial**. An analysis is made of the expected profits and costs if the
  project is disrupted.

- **Technical**. The availability of technologies, automated tools, system
  support for the implementation of planned works is specified.

- **Managerial**. The quality and quantity of labor resources are studied. The
  need for personnel training, attracting new specialists, changing working
  conditions is determined.

- **External**. The impact of the environment, social and economic factors on
  the project implementation is studied.

- **Value**. It considers issues of motivation, corporate cooperation, and the
  potential value of the project for the organization's activities.

## How the goal pyramid works

![How the goal pyramid works](/goals-pyramid-1024x342.webp)

This goal-setting tool divides key objectives into levels. At the very top of
the pyramid are the strategic goals to be achieved in the future. Below them
are:

- **Vision**. This is the result the company wants to see. That is, the ideal
  image to which it aspires. The more vividly the image of the project is
  visualized, the more chances for its successful implementation.

- **Mission**. This includes the company's values, ideals and ultimate goals.
  Based on the mission, regulations that require mandatory fulfillment by
  employees are developed.

- **Strategic Goals**. This is the foundation of the organization's work.
  Strategic planning is carried out in the area of finances, internal resources,
  consumers and prospects of the company's development.

- **Specific tasks**. These are formulated for each department or member of the
  workflow. They serve as a guideline to be followed on the way to accomplishing
  the main task.

## Mistakes hindering the achievement of project goals and objectives

Sometimes a project is derailed due to various problems. The following signs are
indicative of project failure:

- Exceeding financial expenditures beyond budget.

- Delaying its implementation over time.

- Decrease in the quality of work performed under the project.

To avoid disruption, project goals should be as realistic and achievable as
possible. Tasks should be fixed on paper or in planners, as well as written out
so that team members understand what actions need to be taken. The best task
managers are detailed in this article.

Employees must be motivated to successfully accomplish the tasks assigned to
them. And senior management should monitor and support their work. Provide
sufficient resources for efficient work. Provide quality technical and
information support at every stage.
