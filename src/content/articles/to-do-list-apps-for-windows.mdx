A to-do list app is a solution that lets you compose lists of tasks and track
their completion. It's a good time management tool that can boost your private
and professional productivity. Many apps offer advanced functionality, such as
attaching files to tasks, collaboration opportunities or even habits tracking.
In this article, we'll tell you about the best solutions that you can install on
a computer or laptop with the Windows operating system. Some of them are
available as freeware and others charge a subscription fee. Some are rather
simplistic while others are suitable for handling complex projects at work.
Hopefully, this information will help you select the top option for your needs
and budget.

## 1\. LeaderTask

![LeaderTask](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.8

🏴 **Free version**: 3-day trial

🏳️ **Paid version**: Starting with $2.18 per individual per month

👍 **Coolest feature**: Offline availability

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Its functionality might seem too complex to some users

This one lets you create an unlimited number of tasks, divide them into
subtasks, flexibly modify their settings, sort them, make them recurring and
compose lists of tasks. You'll be able to create a new task inside the app by
simply forwarding an email to it. If you use Mozilla Firefox, you can also use
widgets to create tasks — all you need to do is install the extension.
[LeaderTask](/downloads) can send notifications and reminders to you: the former
come into play when a change occurs and the latter prevent you from forgetting
important things.

Feel free to combine tasks into projects and share them with the other team
members. You'll be able to collectively discuss tasks right in the app, comment
on them and attach documents to them. The app allows you to assign different
roles to users and distribute tasks accordingly. It will be convenient for you
to monitor the progress of each member with the help of productivity metrics and
task completion graphs. All the functions will remain available when you go
offline.

At first sight, the LeaderTask functionality can seem excessive for a private
user — but the learning curve is shallow. To sum up our impressions, we'd like
to call it the best to do list app for Windows.

## 2\. Todoist

![ToDoist Planner](/ToDoist-Planner-1024x655.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.6

🏴 **Free version**: Yes, for up to 5 active projects and 5 guests

🏳️ **Paid version**: Starting with $4 per individual per month

👍 **Coolest feature**: Ability to handle multiple projects at one

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Limited functionality of the free version

Its interface can look a bit simplistic. But when you start digging deeper,
you'll discover that Todoist is powerful and rich in features. It lets you
create tasks, label and filter them, set deadlines and combine tasks into
projects. You'll be able to save projects as templates, clone and archive them.
Todoist will automatically remind you about the upcoming due dates. Its built-in
productivity tool enables you to monitor your daily and weekly progress. It
should be convenient for you to track your efficiency with karma points. This
app nicely synchronizes with various platforms.

Todoist is perfect for collaborative efforts and juggling multiple projects
simultaneously. But to appreciate it to the max, it's necessary to upgrade to
the paid version.

## 3\. Amazing Marvin

![Amazing Marvin](/Amazingmarvin_windows-1024x514.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.6

🏴 **Free version**: 30-day free trial

🏳️ **Paid version**: Starting with $8 per individual per month

👍 **Coolest feature**: Focus mode that lets you concentrate on one task

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Lack of a free plan

To get started, you'll need to introduce yourself to this app. There is a short
survey to reveal your expectations, needs and productivity challenges. Then, you
can benefit from a comprehensive guide on the app's functionality. Its structure
is very complex but not cluttered. You can create tasks, make them recurring and
turn them into projects or categories. Amazing Marvin enables you to assign
priorities for each task, estimate its time limits, set deadlines and add notes.

When juggling multiple tasks, you might get prone to distractions. In this case,
open a task in the full-screen mode and temporarily block the others. To boost
your productivity, you can use the built-in habit tracker and Pomodoro counter.
Amazing Marvin allows you to set high-level goals and comes up with strategies
to enhance your organization.

The biggest shortcoming of this product is the lack of a free plan — but there
is a 30-day free trial.

## 4\. TickTick

![TickTick App](/ticktick-app-1024x576.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.6

🏴 **Free version**: Yes

🏳️ **Paid version**: $35.99 per year

👍 **Coolest feature**: Widgets for Windows

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Lack of reminders and calendar view in the free version

Just like the previous option, this one has a deceptively simple interface and
powerful functionality. You can group tasks into categories, set deadlines, add
tags and use filters. You'll be able to convert tasks into notes and back again,
divide them into subtasks and make them nested. If you don't need a list of
tasks anymore, archive it — and if you realize you want to check it once again,
unarchive it. TickTick features a Pomodoro timer and a habit tracker. It
integrates with Outlook, Google and other third-party solutions. You'll
appreciate the native Windows widgets — such as the sticky note one, calendar
view or task list. It's one of the best tools for juggling multiple projects.

The key flaw of this app is that you need to upgrade to premium to make the most
of it.

## 5\. Monday.com

![Monday.com](/monday_comm_windows-1024x576.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

🏴 **Free version**: Yes, with 5 GB of storage and 2 users

🏳️ **Paid version**: Starting with $8 per individual per month

👍 **Coolest feature**: Pre-built templates for various niches

👎 **Biggest drawback**: The process of adding subtasks is not too intuitive

Consider this one if you appreciate flexible task management and regularly
collaborate on tasks with your colleagues. The interface is clean and selected
features are color-coded. You can benefit from time tracking, custom reports and
drag-and-drop functionality. You'll be able to switch between various visual
formats, such as table, chart, form and Kanban. There is a map view for
location-based projects. Monday.com features pre-built templates for HR, design,
marketing and other niches. It integrates with various third-party solutions,
such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft Teams and others. It comes in equally
handy for big and small teams and is optimal for handling complex projects.

It's not so easy to find flaws with this app — but they exist. The developers
could have improved the process of adding subtasks.

## 6\. ClickUp

![ClickUp](/ClickUp_img-1024x680.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

🏴 **Free version**: Yes

🏳️ **Paid version**: Starting with $9 per individual per month

👍 **Coolest feature**: Flexible customization

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Substandard reporting features

It's a powerful and versatile app, perfect for business. It allows you to manage
your time and tasks and collaborate with colleagues in real time. It will be
easy for you to create, search and filter tasks, add comments to tasks and
resolve them, import files from third-party apps and track your time. You'll be
able to drag and drop items, build charts and customize your reports. It's
enough to make one click to assign several tasks to a user. ClickUp integrates
with many other apps and features templates for different professional niches.

As for the drawbacks, a private individual can find the functionality of this
app excessive. Plus, its reporting features are not as user-friendly as what
some competitors offer.

## 7\. Notion

![Notion](/notion-1024x621.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

🏴 **Free version**: Yes and a 30-day free trial

🏳️ **Paid version**: Starting with $8 per individual per month

👍 **Coolest feature**: Pre-built templates for different spheres

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Not too intuitive navigation

It's much more than a checklist tool. Instead, it's a full-fledged work
management app that supports real-time collaboration. There are many view
formats to choose from — such as list, calendar, timeline, gallery, table and
Kanban. You can drag and drop items, create custom reports, track time and use
built-in spreadsheets. There are templates for users from different professional
spheres. This app can send you notifications via email, push or third-party
apps. Notion integrates with databases and over 50 popular solutions — among
them Figma, Slack and Dropbox.

On the flip side, you might struggle to find the necessary feature at the first
attempt. The navigation leaves a bit to be desired.

## 8\. WeekToDo

![WeekToDo](/Week_todo_windows.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

🏴 **Free version**: Yes, it's an open-source product available to anyone

🏳️ **Paid version**: No

👍 **Coolest feature**: Focus on completing tasks

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Lack of cross-device synchronization

Many organizer apps enable you to create visually appealing lists. Only selected
software solutions genuinely motivate you to complete tasks. WeekToDo is focused
on completion. Its interface is rather basic and lacks fancy settings — but at
least you can switch between the light and the dark mode. Feel free to create
custom task lists and arrange them by day of the week. Move the tasks,
color-code them and set time limits and alarms for them. Make tasks recurring,
divide them into subtasks and add descriptions to them.

Unlike many alternatives, WeekToDo lacks a mobile version. If you want to
transfer data from it to your smartphone, you can do it manually. Automated
synchronization is impossible. You'll be able to export and import data from the
web version of the app to your desktop to create backups.

## 9\. Sleek

![Sleek](/sleek_app_windows-1024x649.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.4

🏴 **Free version**: Yes, it's an open-source product available to anyone

🏳️ **Paid version**: No

👍 **Coolest feature**: Opportunity to keep all your tasks in a single text file

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Limited visualization, text-only approach

To create a task, it's enough to type in a single text command. You can indicate
the priority and the deadline for each task, specify its context or the project
that it belongs to as well as add a description and recurrence interval. The app
will help you with formatting. You'll be able to split tasks into several
documents, search for them and filter them. Sleek enables you to switch between
the dark and light themes. It lets you customize selected aspects — such as
notifications and prioritization.

As for the drawbacks, the text-only approach might fail to inspire users who
value fancy visualization. Another challenge is the lack of cross-gadget
synchronization. If you wish to use Sleek from your smartphone, you'll need to
install a mobile client and let it access your tasks-related data from a cloud.

## 10\. Lunatask

![Lunatask](/LunaTask_windows-1024x519.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.4

🏴 **Free version**: Yes

🏳️ **Paid version**: Starting with $6 per individual per month

👍 **Coolest feature**: Goal-oriented task management

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Excessive add-ons

This app has a curious concept. You can group your todos in lists called Areas
of Life and set goals for each area. Add tasks to goals and monitor your
progress in the area with the help of a visual bar. All the conventional
task-related functionality is present: setting deadlines, estimating durations,
making recurring tasks, taking notes and so on. Besides, there are many add-ons
that competitors' apps lack. For instance, you can review your old tasks through
the backlog, switch to Kanban, benefit from the Must/Want/Should method and
prioritize tasks through the Now/Later workflow. You'll be able to track your
habits and mood and use a journal.

Multiple extra features make Lunatask stand out from the other apps in its
niche. However, some users find them overwhelming and excessive.

## 11\. Microsoft To Do

![Microsoft To Do](/Microsoft-To-Do_img-1024x704.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.4

🏴 **Free version**: Yes, it's the only possible way of using the app

🏳️ **Paid version**: No

👍 **Coolest feature**: Integration with other Microsoft products

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Limited customization opportunities

If you have Windows 11, this app is built into it and you don't need to download
it. You can create lists, add custom icons to them, set deadlines and view your
tasks for each date. The My Day view system is sleek and user-friendly. To
collaborate with others, feel free to assign tasks, share lists and control the
collective progress through the intuitive interface. You can easily integrate
this application with other Microsoft products and third-party solutions.

On the flip side, the customization opportunities are limited. The default
functionality is pretty decent — but without any particular wow effect.

## Apps for Making Notes That You Can Use as a Desktop to Do List

The solutions that we described above vary in their functionality. Some are
extremely rich in features. Others are rather basic and don't confuse their
audience with excessive add-ons. In this part of our article, we'd like to
recommend four programs that were originally designed to put notes — but each of
them can also double as a simple to-do manager.

## 12\. Obsidian

![Obsidian](/Obsidian_windows.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.6

🏴 **Free version**: Yes, for individuals

🏳️ **Paid version**: $50 per business user per year

👍 **Coolest feature**: Customization opportunities and add-ons

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Optional paid synchronization

It's the most advanced complex app for notes that can double as a desktop task
list. It lets you save notes as text documents in a folder and manage them in
nested folders. You'll be able to link notes, which comes in handy for
interconnected projects. To check the connection between the notes, you may
switch to the graph view. There is a whole ecosystem of add-ons for Obsidian.
For instance, you can integrate it with ChatGPT, embed videos or switch to the
Kanban view.

This app deserves criticism for its paid syncing feature. But you can avoid it
and carry out synchronization through a cloud storage of your choice.

## 13\. Microsoft OneNote

![Microsoft OneNote](/Microsoft-OneNote_windows.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.5

🏴 **Free version**: Yes, with 5 GB of free storage in Microsoft OneDrive

🏳️ **Paid version**: $69.99 per year — it's not the price of OneNote but that of
the full Microsoft 365 package

👍 **Coolest feature**: Impressive free version

👎 **Biggest drawback**: The in-built version of this app in Windows 10 is not
too powerful

Are you familiar with Microsoft Office apps? If yes, you'll feel at home as soon
as you open OneNote. Its interface and logic are typical of this developer. You
can start typing or doodling on any part of the page. You'll be able to add
images to your texts.

OneNote easily doubles as a to do list for computer. It allows you to create an
unlimited number of notebooks and break them into sections. To organize the
information, you can divide notes into sub-pages. You'll be able to search
notes, content inside the notes and even data inside the documents that you
attach to your notes.

This app is by default present in Windows 10 — but you shouldn't expect top
performance from it. To benefit from the full functionality of the product,
you'd better download it from scratch.

## 14\. Simplenote

![Simplenote app windows](/simplenote_windows-1024x682.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.3

🏴 **Free version**: Yes

🏳️ **Paid version**: No

👍 **Coolest feature**: Simplicity

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Lack of advanced functionality

As its name suggests, this app is genuinely simple. Depending on your tastes and
needs, you can perceive it either as an advantage or a disadvantage. It's a
digital analog of a paper notebook where you can quickly scribble down your
thoughts and plans. It's impossible to add pictures of attach files to notes.
However, there are tags and the search function. Plus, the app supports
cross-platform synchronization. The last argument in its favor is that it was
created by Automattic — the business that invented Tumblr and WordPress.

## 15\. Joplin

![Joplin windows](/Joplin_windows.webp)

💌 **Customer reviews**: 4.3

🏴 **Free version**: Yes

🏳️ **Paid version**: Starting with $2.5 per individual per month — but if you
want to sync Joplin with other devices, be ready to pay from $5 per month for
the cloud version

👍 **Coolest feature**: It's open-source

👎 **Biggest drawback**: Paid synchronization

The fact that this app is open-source means enhanced security. Your notes will
be stored on your device — and not on a server that belongs to a third-party
company. It's not necessary to sign up — it's enough to download Joplin and
begin to type. The interface is simple and conventional for this type of
product. To edit the text, you can choose between Markdown and a rich text
editor. If you prefer the former, it will be more convenient to open the saved
notes in other apps. The selection of tools includes tags and the web clipper to
clip articles that you found online.

The main challenge is synchronization. To perform it, you can use any cloud
service, such as OneDrive or Dropbox. The second way out is to pay for Joplin
Cloud to get a seamless experience.

## Final Thoughts

If you want to better manage your time and tasks, consider installing a
checklist app for Windows. Such solutions are available in multiple varieties
that differ in their price, functionality and design. If you've never tried apps
of this sort before, start with the most basic ones that allow you to take
notes, tag and filter them. More advanced alternatives enable you to collaborate
with other users, assign tasks, track time and perform many other functions. If
you don't know which app to choose, consider LeaderTask. It should be a safe bet
for both private and corporate users. LeaderTask boasts an intuitive interface
and an extensive range of features. You'll be able to use it even when you're
offline. This app offers real-time collaboration opportunities so that all of
your team can stay on the same page and complete tasks on time.
