Chronic lack of time is the scourge of modern man. We work a lot, load our
brains, rush all the time and still don't have time to deal with resource
allocation. It's hard to accept, but this is the reason why we are in a state of
constant stress. If you can not deal with a huge number of current problems,
it's time to learn self-organization and competent management of your working
and personal time. For this purpose, science has developed a special set of
technologies and components that have a common name: time management. We will
briefly tell you how to stop procrastinating and deal with the chaos in everyday
affairs.

## What it is and how it works

Management theory teaches how to allocate time and meet deadlines. This
scientific and economic trend has a rich history and includes various
techniques, know-how and methods that teach how to allocate tasks and
responsibilities in order to always have time for everything. In simple words,
this concept means a set of actions or exercises aimed at improving personal and
team performance. Time management can be given the following characterization -
a composite set of techniques that help not to waste time. Applying even the
basics of time management in the professional sphere and personal life, you can
master the management of your life processes and learn to always achieve your
goals.

**The concept of time management encompasses different spheres of activity:**

- setting goals, defining mission, strategy;

- time allocation;

- resource management and task delegation;

- prioritization;

- making daily to-do lists;

- time cost estimation analysis;

- improved productivity and personal effectiveness;

- formation of self-discipline and many others.

**Modern time management is divided into two main areas:**

- personal or individual (used to achieve personal goals);

- corporate or organizational (aims to manage the organization).

## Tasks that help to solve

Utilizing this technology in your work or personal life helps you solve many key
problems at the same time:

- **Accomplish more in less time**. Thanks to the ability to plan time, you can
  take your life "under control", learn to cope with serious tasks faster to
  achieve better results.

- **Become more successful in all areas**. This methodology gives specific
  recommendations on how to increase productivity, organize work and personal
  space properly.

- **Allocate time for really important things**. Due to time deficit, a modern
  person usually does not have enough time for self-development, favorite hobby
  or communication with close people. Mastering the skill of time management
  allows you to effectively deal with "chronophages". You will be able to get
  rid of unnecessary cases to do what is really valuable and important. This
  means that the function of management is mastered and you will be able to live
  a full, rich and happier life.

- **Set realistic goals for yourself and learn how to achieve them**. Everyone
  can dream. Someone imagines himself in the chair of a successful manager,
  another dreams of a career as an artist, but most desires and aspirations
  remain unrealized in ordinary life. The ability to plan skillfully transforms
  abstract dreams into concrete actions. Having clear goals in front of your
  eyes, it is easier and faster to approach them.

- **Managing your life**. Most people are dissatisfied with their way of life,
  but never make an attempt to change anything. As a result, life becomes a
  "slow drift downstream" that turns into a dreary quagmire in places. We are
  doing work we don't like, being in places where we shouldn't be. And many
  agree with the fact that such an existence does not bring positive emotions.
  But, one's life can be managed. And, time management provides a full set of
  tools for this purpose, which help to own the situation under any conditions.

Having learned the lesson of competent planning of personal time, you will be
able to allocate from the endless stream of daily tasks important ones, and
spend more effort to solve them as soon as possible. This will give you the
necessary means and strength for a full life, education or communication with
your family.

## Development history

The term "time management" originated in the 1960s and was first used in the
book "The Time Trap" by Alec Mackenzie. In the book, the author discusses the
problems people face when planning their time and offers appropriate solutions.
But, of course, people had been asking time management questions before.

About 2,000 years ago, the ancient Roman philosopher Seneca wrote in his letters
to the poet Lucilius that it was necessary to keep a written record of time, and
to divide the time spent into good, bad and useless. The outstanding Italian
scientist and architect of the Renaissance Leon Battista Alberti believed that
if a person is able to manage time, he will succeed in any business. For himself
he derived two rules of planning and strictly adhered to them until the end of
his life. Every day Alberti started with making a list of things to do for the
day. The list itself was formed taking into account the priority. At the
beginning were the most important things, and at the end - the lowest priority.
Activities such as sleeping, entertainment, and eating were not as important to
Alberti as work.

The Industrial Revolution and subsequent industrialization gave a great impetus
to the development of time management. Factories with dozens and hundreds of
workers required a new approach to work organization. Strict schedules with
working shifts appeared at production facilities. The principles of scientific
organization of work and management were described by Frederick Taylor in his
works.

If the XIX century was focused on the organization of physical labor, the XX
century - on increasing the efficiency of intellectual labor. The real boom on
the topic of time management came in the second half of the last century. In
1973, Alan Liken's book entitled "How to Gain Control of Your Time and Your
Life" was published. In 1989, Stephen Covey published the book "The 7 Habits of
Highly Effective People", which to this day remains one of the best works on
time management.

With the development of technology and the advent of the Internet, interest in
the subject has only increased. Today there are dozens of trainings and courses
that will help you learn to manage your time, dozens of books are published
every year, and more and more people are realizing the importance of time
management. In addition, thanks to smartphones and various applications, it has
become more convenient to plan your day and manage your schedule.

## Myths about time management

Many people continue to neglect the organization of their day, considering it a
waste of time. During the existence of time management on the topic of planning,
many myths have arisen, and some of them we will now consider.

#### Myth 1. Time management is an innate skill

A person may have a predisposition to time management, but time management
cannot be called an innate skill. For example, choleric and sanguine people by
nature are less inclined to be organized than phlegmatic and melancholic people.
However, the character and behavior of a person is also influenced by
environment, education, financial status and, to a greater extent, previous
experience.

Time management is nothing but a set of time management tools that need to be
mastered. Some will take less time, others more. The result depends not on
innate abilities, but on the time and effort invested.

#### Myth 2: Time management turns people into robots

Some people believe that time management limits freedom and destroys any
spontaneity in life. After all, you have to live according to a schedule, stick
to the designated plan for the day, because of which life becomes not at all in
joy. The emergence of this myth is due to the fact that books on time management
often suggest planning every minute, write down any actions and do only useful
things.

You should not take such advice literally. It is quite difficult to accomplish
all the things you have planned for the day, and it has nothing to do with your
productivity. Many factors beyond your control are bound to make adjustments, so
you should not plan more than 60% of your day. Leave time for force majeure and
urgent tasks.

Designate a few key tasks for the day that must be done, and spend the rest of
the day doing things you've wanted to do for a long time. In this case, you will
have time for spontaneity, and at the end of the day - a pleasant satisfaction
for a productive day. But keep in mind that being free to choose what to do at a
particular moment does not mean surrendering to immediate desires.

#### Myth 3. Time management is only necessary for those who are always late

Time management in English means time management. In practice, the meaning of
the term is much broader and implies life management. Time management offers
methods that help to formulate goals and properly prioritize in order to focus
on really important tasks. Each of us carries out such manipulations on a daily
basis.

#### Myth 4. Creative people don't need to plan anything

Planning implies following a predetermined list of things to do, which is quite
contrary to the nature of creative people who are driven by feelings and
inspiration. However, if creativity has become a profession, time management
becomes essential. You can't wait for inspiration to strike, or you'll have
nothing to live on.

Time management is part of any job, including creative work. It is important to
meet deadlines, to switch quickly between projects and tasks, and to find time
to improve your skills if you want to become a sought-after professional.

#### Myth 5. My life will change just by implementing planning

Thanks to dozens of books on success and productivity, there is a perception
that time management is the pill for all problems. But to make time management
work you need to change your mindset, and this is especially hard for those who
have never planned anything. You will also need to study and try dozens of
planning methods, choose the right ones, and then build your own time management
system.

At the same time, the system needs to be constantly refined. Life is very
changeable, and new circumstances may force you to rethink your approach to
planning. Over time, you will have new needs and the number of tasks will only
grow. The goal of time management is to help you stay productive throughout your
life. It will require you to constantly work on yourself.

## Basic Principles

![Basic Principles of time management](/principy-time-managementa-1024x410.webp)

The principles of time planning are its general rules and at the same time its
distinctive features. They differ from person to person. Consider that what is
good and useful for one, may be absolutely unimportant for another.
Nevertheless, time management holds on to a few basic rules, without which its
tools simply won't work:

1. **Goal setting**. Time management starts with setting goals. In order to
   change something in business or life, it is necessary to set appropriate
   goals and strive to achieve them within a set time frame. By time of
   realization they can be global (occupying the whole life) or specific (for a
   month, a day or a year). Having clearly formulated a general goal, you will
   do half the work, as you will clearly understand in which direction to go.

2. **Planning**. It helps to make any activity organized and structured. It is
   one of the most important tools for increasing personal efficiency, which
   works in different spheres of life.

3. **Motivation**. Not all tasks will be easy and quick. Some will require more
   time, and sometimes you will have to force yourself. Motivation can be a
   great motivator, so it's important to understand why it disappears and how to
   get it back. For example, motivation can disappear if a task seems pointless
   to you or if you feel negative emotions when doing it. Conversely, motivation
   will come if you learn to praise yourself for the work you do and reward
   yourself for successes.

4. **Prioritization of objectives**. Global goals consist of smaller tasks.
   Sometimes their number is so large that it is not expedient, or rather,
   physically impossible, to perform all current activities at the same time.
   Therefore, among this endless stream, it is necessary to subdivide tasks into
   really important and urgent matters that will give the best result, and less
   prioritized ones.

5. **Task structuring**. In order to understand how successfully a task has been
   accomplished, it is necessary to determine by what type and criteria it
   should be evaluated. In other words, any goals, tasks, and actions resulting
   from them should be measured and correlated with the real state of affairs.

6. **Rationalization of habits**. The reason for failure can be wrong habits, so
   for time management to be effective, you need to properly analyze them. Bad
   habits like smoking and browsing social media before bedtime should be
   abandoned, as they disrupt sleep and are harmful to health.

7. **Formation of the skill of self-discipline**. This is one of the most
   important qualities of an organized and successful person. Without developing
   the habit of moving clearly and consistently to the intended goals, it is
   impossible to fully utilize time management.

8. **Written goal setting**. It is not enough to set realistic and achievable
   goals. They need to be fixed in a classic paper diary or a special
   application - task manager. This will help to relieve your head from
   unnecessary information, and also allows you to be aware of all the upcoming
   cases. Thus, fixing tasks helps to improve productivity and reduce stress.

9. **Decomposition**. To successfully accomplish a large-scale,
   difficult-to-achieve task, it must be broken down into smaller subtasks. Then
   the global goal will not seem abstract and unfeasible. By breaking things
   down into separate actions and stages, you can make better progress in
   planning. Delegation is also a way for employers to gain some time for
   themselves.

10. **Delegation**. Your time and energy are limited, so it's important to focus
    on key tasks and delegate those that can be done by others. To stay
    productive, you need to learn to prioritize and trust others.

11. **Hierarchy of objectives**. Smaller tasks should be a kind of "stepping
    stones" on the way to achieving the main goal. When making a tactical plan
    for the year, it is necessary to compare it with the plan for the month.
    When planning things for the week, do not forget to take into account the
    schedule of tasks for the day. This will make it easier to move in the right
    direction towards the key goal.

12. **Analysis**. Without summarizing the day and week, it is impossible to
    identify problems and assess how well you have done. Analysis is one of the
    most important elements of time management. By analyzing previous
    experience, we can find out the reasons for failures and correct them in the
    future.

13. **Eliminating chronophages** ("time eaters"). There are many distractions
    that mercilessly destroy our precious time. These include endless phone
    calls, watching TV shows and Youtube videos, and "hanging out on social
    media". Constant noise in the office, visitors interrupting the performance
    of basic tasks, meetings organized without reason, also negatively affect
    performance and productivity. But the main role in the distraction from the
    implementation of the intended goals play a lack of self-discipline and
    personal disorganization. These are prerequisites for learning how to manage
    your time.

14. **Struggling with multitasking**. Striving to do all the work quickly and
    efficiently is very commendable and positive. But it is not right at all, so
    you will do yourself much more harm than good. When one person strives to
    simultaneously fulfill a huge amount of tasks, often unrelated to each
    other, there is a decrease in productivity and the development of chronic
    stress. Every moment of time should be devoted to one thing.

15. **Vacation Planning**. Vacation is as important a part of life as work, so
    planning it should be approached carefully and never neglected. Staying
    energized for a long time is only possible with regular vacations and time
    spent with family and friends.

When implementing these principles in your work or personal life, you should not
forget about your own development. Without self-discipline and mastering
self-management skills, it is impossible to improve personal effectiveness.

## Top modern methods

![Top modern methods of time management](/time-management-pomodoro-1-1024x385.webp)

It is worth noting that most time management techniques are based on the ability
to plan, prioritize and structure tasks. In our next selection, we will list and
review in detail the popular and most effective time management techniques and
methods that are suitable for both team leaders and managers, as well as for
those who are new to planning. Learn the secrets of the techniques that will
teach you how to manage your time more correctly and subdue it as a result.

### 1\. The 10-minute method

If you need to complete a task and you don't feel like doing it, convince
yourself that you will take no more than 10 minutes to do it. Do it right away,
without putting it off for another time. By focusing on the task at hand, you
are more likely to complete it.

### 2\. Technique 1-3-5

This technique will help you use your working time more rationally and wisely.
To do this, you need to make a list of nine things to do. Include one major
task, three medium-sized tasks and five small tasks. In total, they will turn
out to be nine. Following this rule, you can quickly put things in order. You
will have time for everything and will be less tired.

### 3\. 4D

At the end of the 20th century, motivational writer Edward Ray used his
experience to come up with a time management technique that is still in use
today. This method involves categorizing all tasks into four grades. It is
suitable for short-term planning when many different things have to be done in a
limited time. The names of the categories may sound as follows:

- **Do**. This will include things of the highest importance that need to be
  completed as soon as possible.

- **Delegate**. Here you will find tasks that can be delegated to an assistant,
  colleague or secretary.

- **Delete**. In this category you should place tasks that can be painlessly
  deleted from the list without any consequences.

- **Delay**. This will include long-term tasks that can be postponed until a
  certain time. To avoid losing sight of them, it is important to set a specific
  due date for each task.

### 4\. The rule of three important things to do

This technique, developed by Chris Bailey, states that it is enough to do three
serious things during the day, which will give more results. This will eliminate
the need to spend energy on a couple of dozens of current tasks on the daily
checklist. From the total list, you should choose the three most important items
and focus on their fulfillment. The next day, choose three more tasks from the
remaining ones. In this way you will be able to concentrate on the main things,
keep your mind clear and focused.

### 5\. 90/30

Using this technique, you should work actively for 90 minutes. Then give
yourself half an hour to rest. Then the cycle repeats. The first 90 minutes
should be allocated to important tasks that need to be accomplished during the
day. The remaining cycles should be devoted to minor tasks. This scheme will be
convenient for people who think in time intervals.

### 6\. Fresh or Fried

This technique will be just right for those who often put off things "for
later". This technique teaches that important tasks should be done first thing
in the morning, "fresh in the mind". This technique teaches that important tasks
should be done in the morning, "with a fresh head". In order to have an idea of
where to start, lists of things to do in the morning are made in the evening.

### 7\. Eat the frog

Among all the daily chores, you should choose the most unpleasant task. You
should "deal" with it first. In this way you will get rid of the burden of
responsibility and ensure a positive attitude for the rest of your time. The
author of this method is Brian Tracy, a specialist in self-development. In his
opinion, "eat the frog" should be quickly, without thinking. And do not agonize
over the fact that sooner or later you will have to do it anyway.

### 8\. Time blocks

No matter how many tasks you have on your list, it's hard to know how much time
you have to spend on one thing or another. After all, the items "Make a
quarterly report" or "Order stationery" have the same lines on the list. But
they are completely different things in terms of duration and level of labor
input. On the calendar, you can control the time required for solving the
planned tasks visually. For this purpose, the tasks, depending on the time of
their fulfillment, are given the form of blocks. You start with the most
difficult ones, without distracting yourself with minor tasks.

### 9\. Eisenhower matrix

A productive approach to time management helps you maximize the importance of
your own to-do's and categorize them.

The matrix consists of four sides named A, B, C, D. To build it, you need to
draw a Descartes chart with four equal sectors. First of all, it is necessary to
make a complete list of actual things that need to be done. After that, the
tasks should be distributed and crammed into sectors according to the degree of
importance and urgency. In this case, square A includes important and urgent
tasks, B - important and non-urgent, C - unimportant and urgent, D - unimportant
and non-urgent.

### 10\. GTD (Getting Things Done)

This popular system, based on seeing tasks through to completion, is described
in his book by David Allen, a master business planner who knows how to do it. It
is based on elements of time management and information processing techniques.
It works as follows:

- All tasks are recorded in one place called Inbox.

- The contents of the folder are sorted periodically, prioritizing the tasks on
  the list by priority and deadlines. Tasks that are similar in meaning or
  occurrence are combined into common folders: "Work", "Study", "Home",
  "Travel", and so on.

- Based on the results of regular audits, completed or obsolete cases are
  expunged or sent to the archives.

- Once a comprehensive plan has been drawn up, specific actions are taken. Quick
  tasks that take a couple of minutes are done immediately. Others are delegated
  to colleagues, employees or moved to the agenda with a due date.

The list should be concrete, not overloaded with vague, abstract tasks. It
should be freely available for regular editing and revision.

### 11\. Kanban-board

An effective methodology developed in Japan that visualizes the workflow. It
refers to Agile management methods used in companies engaged in tracker
development and launching new, original products.

It has the form of a table with several columns, in which tasks are recorded by
categories: "To be done", "In progress" and "Done". Tasks written on post-it
notes are placed in the first column. As you work on them, the notes are moved
down the columns. Thus, it is possible to visually track the employment,
efficiency of each performer working on the task. The kanban technique is
successfully combined with other time management tools, for example, with the
rule of time blocks.

### 12\. Method Pomodoro

The technique got its name thanks to the tomato-shaped timer that its creator,
Francesco Cirillo, used to control the time. Another name for it is the "25
minute rule". When you start working, you set the timer for 25 minutes. You
devote all that time to active work. Then you take a five-minute break. After
that time, you return to the task at hand. Every four cycles, you need to take a
30-minute rest break. This tool helps you do more in a limited amount of time.
It is relevant for workaholics who find it difficult to allocate time for rest
during the day. Allows you to feel the value of time and become more successful
and productive.

### 13\. Iceberg method

This concept teaches how to properly handle incoming information. All e-mails,
notes, and other important information are stored in one common place. For
example, in an electronic diary application, task manager or other service. Then
they structure this data with folders, categories, and tags. Every few weeks,
this information is studied and analyzed, which can be used in practice.
Unnecessary files are archived or deleted. In this way, a personal knowledge
base can be formed.

### 14\. ZTD Technique

The author of the method is Leo Babauta, author of Zenhabits, a blog dedicated
to personal effectiveness. The name of the method is "Zen to Done". It is a
simplified version of the GTD method and is based on 10 simple skills:

1. All information should be collected in a common folder ("Inbox").

2. New files are processed as soon as they are received.

3. Sort tasks into categories based on their content and complexity.

4. Key tasks are planned in advance. If they are large and large-scale, think
   about their fulfillment for a week in advance.

5. Each task should be given its own time. Do not spread your attention over a
   bunch of small tasks.

6. To-do lists should be specific, short and clear.

7. Stick to a consistent daily regimen.

8. Do something you're really interested in.

9. Keep only the important and urgent things on the task list. The tasks on the
   list should be clearly and concisely worded.

10. The list should be analyzed regularly, removing unnecessary things from it.

The technique is suitable for people who have difficulty implementing the GTD
technique.

There are many proven and tested time management systems, the main thing is to
motivate yourself to self-discipline and start practicing and testing the most
interesting ones.

## Tips for implementing time management techniques

If you are not ready to immerse yourself in science, study serious research,
take online trainings and radically change your life or perception of the
environment, but want to become more productive and successful, we recommend
learning the basics of self-development, taken from different methods:

- Every day solve one important task that will help you get closer to your main
  goal. You should devote about an hour a day to this task.

- The golden rule of time management is to take breaks and rest properly and
  avoid overwork.

- Divide the global goal into smaller tasks that can be completed within a
  month. Each month, complete one of them. In this way, you will gradually move
  in the right direction towards achieving the main goal.

- Use the two-minute rule. It says: things that take no more than a few minutes
  should be done immediately, without putting them off. Once done, cross it off
  the list.

- Alternate between different activities. Such an expedient approach will avoid
  overwork and help you take a break from monotonous, monotonous work.

- Set specific deadlines for each task. This will be a great incentive to
  maintain the skill of self-discipline and will help to allocate time wisely.

- Get rid of junk in your head, plans and life. There are many interesting
  articles and books written on this topic. Example: "Magical Cleaning. The
  Japanese art of putting order at home and in life" by Marie Kondo.

All of the above methods have 1 important feature - they are available to
everyone and can be applied by almost anyone and at any time. These methods
