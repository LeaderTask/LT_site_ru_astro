The solution of some issues requires collective discussion. Only in this format
is it possible to come up with unconventional, creative and truly imaginative
ideas. One convenient tool for finding "fresh solutions" is brainstorming or
brainstorming. With this technique, you can look at a situation from a different
angle. Its main goal is to gather as many opinions and ideas as possible on the
issue at hand, so that you can then put them into practice.

## What it is

![What it is brainstorming](/brainstorming.webp)

Brainstorm is a creative idea generation technique used in work groups or teams
to solve specific problems in an informal setting. The term was coined by Alex
Osborne, co-owner of the advertising agency BBDO. He believed that in order to
find the right solution to a problem, it was important to separate creative
processes aimed at creating new solutions from criticism. This technology was
then used by other advertising agencies and marketing departments to create
slogans, advertising campaigns, and new product packaging.

In a brainstorming session, it is important to give freedom to creative energy,
not to be afraid to voice the most fantastic assumptions. All participants in
the discussion should have the same freedom of expression regardless of their
position or position in the company. Brainstorming helps to break out of the
routine that comes from working in a monotonous format. But in order to get the
appropriate effect from this method, it is necessary to prepare for the
discussion thoroughly and follow the rules of the discussion.

## Why brainstorm

Brainstorm help situations:

- When you're in a stupor and can't see a solution to a problem;

- When you need to come up with something new and original quickly;

- When you need to give your brain a jolt.

That is, this method works best when all employees have different ideas about
the same task, but no one knows how to do it correctly. Here is the simplest
example from life: you and your company are going to a friend's birthday party
and are deciding what to get him. You have a brainstorming session where you
share your opinions on the gift. Some of you may come up with the same ideas,
but among them there will definitely be an original and not banal variant.

Apart from the marketing sphere brainstorming is practiced in Agile teams and
has the same goals as any other. Only the team consists of
programmers-developers.

## How a brainstorm is conducted

Brainstorming ideas is conducted in several stages. First, it is necessary to
decide on the issue to be solved. Then determine the number and composition of
the team members. Optimally, if there will be no more than 10 people in it. So
it will be easier to manage the process, and the meeting will not turn into an
endless hum. All participants should have approximately the same positions,
social statuses, so that it would be easier for them to communicate and
understand each other. Preferably, they should have different levels of Soft and
Hard Skills, in different areas. This gives better results in generating
non-standard and creative ideas.

Having decided on the number and composition of the team, you need to choose a
venue for the event. It can be the territory of the office or a neutral place
outside it, where you can go with your colleagues. Staying in an informal
environment will be an excellent stimulus for turning on the creative
imagination of the company's employees and will help them to abstract themselves
from the work process. New environment - new ideas. The main thing is not to
overdo it with relaxation, otherwise the task will remain unsolved.
Brainstorming sessions can also be organized in an online format, using modern
technical means.

Next steps:

- Employees are warned about the meeting in advance, 2-3 days in advance,
  setting specific goals for them: for example, to come up with 200 ideas in an
  hour.

- Select a brainstorming moderator who will make sure that the participants of
  the brainstorming session follow the rules and regulations of the
  brainstorming session.

- Assign performers to other roles: the generator of ideas (creator); the
  analyst; the person responsible for summarizing and summarizing the results of
  the event; the implementer who understands best and has a certain set of hard
  skills for mitap brainstorming; the skeptic who criticizes all statements; the
  "simpleton" who needs to explain everything additionally.

All participants of the brainstorm should understand the essence of the task
under discussion. Therefore, it is necessary to choose the clearest possible
wording for it. Wrong: "Why do we have so few leads for this product?". Correct:
"How can we increase the number of leads in this area?".

After the topic of the meeting is announced, there is a short warm-up. This
helps to establish communication and loosen up. This is followed by a process of
idea generation, during which all participants share their thoughts. It is
important that everyone can offer as many different solutions as possible. All
of them are listened to carefully, without expressing any doubts or criticism.
The ideas expressed during the brainstorm are recorded in writing by the
moderator for later study and analysis. If at any point the discussion reaches
an impasse, the moderator, with the help of leading questions, changes the
direction of the conversation, bringing the discussants back to the original
topic.

In order to select the best ideas from the proposed options, they are divided
into groups. The final selection is made collegially or with the involvement of
invited experts.

## Brainstorming rules

To prevent the brainstorming session from turning into useless chatter, it is
important to follow the following rules:

1. Prepare for it in advance, taking care of the availability of appropriate
   materials and visualization tools, for example,
   [create video presentation](https://invideo.io/make/video-presentation/) or a
   simple presentation on the issue under discussion.

2. All ideas must be recorded in writing. A responsible secretary is chosen for
   this purpose.

3. Criticism of the speaker is not allowed unless it is in accordance with the
   assigned role. Participants should be polite to each other and show empathy
   to others.

4. To get the best result, it is advisable to assemble a cross-platform team,
   with different knowledge and skills.

5. A brain storm mitup should end on a positive note. For example, a great way
   to end it would be a joint dinner where colleagues can socialize in an
   informal setting and get motivated to continue participating in similar
   events.

6. To analyze errors, it is important to organize feedback from the participants
   of the discussion. For this purpose, you can create a short questionnaire in
   Google docs or corporate messenger that employees can fill out anonymously.

It is very important to write down the conclusions and all thoughts so that you
can come back to them again.

## Popular Brainstorming Techniques

Besides the classic scenario proposed by Alex Osborne, there are many other
methods of organizing and conducting a brainstorm, such as:

### "Six Hats"

![six hats method](/six-hats-original-1024x534.webp)

The 6 hats are six roles distributed by color:

- The owner of the black hat criticizes, looking for minuses in the statements
  of the participants;

- The blue hat is conventionally "worn" by the moderator;

- White is associated with analytical thinking, its possessor concentrates on
  finding more information;

- The red one is given to a person with a well-developed intuition, able to
  appreciate the aesthetic side of the issue;

- Yellow color - the opposite of black, its bearer defends the expressed ideas,
  finds positive aspects in them;

- The participant holding the green hat is responsible for creativity, coming up
  with the most original and out-of-the-box ideas.

### The Stepladder technique

It consists of five stages:

1. Participants are told the topic of the discussion, allowing some amount of
   time for them to come up with a solution to the problem.

2. They create a group of two participants. They discuss the problem together.

3. Then another staff member joins them. He tells his ideas to the other two
   participants before, then they discuss them together again.

4. Next, another person is added to the process and so on.

5. After all team members have expressed their opinions on the problem and
   discussed them with each other, a final decision is made.

### Round-Robin methodology

It is conducted at a large round table. A presenter is appointed to voice the
problem. All participants write down solutions on sheets of paper and pass them
around the circle to their colleagues. Each next person has to complete the
proposed variant and write it down as well. The rounds are repeated until the
sheets are returned to the original authors. All ideas are then discussed
further.
