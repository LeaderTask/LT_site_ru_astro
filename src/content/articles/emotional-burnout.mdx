Lately, things have been going unusually well for you. You work a lot and hardly
ever rest, forgetting about adequate rest and sleep. Active work gives its
results: you have an interesting, promising project, high salary. Everything
seems to be great, and the busy rhythm of life is not frightening at all, but it
is a pity that there are no extra hours in the day, then you could have more
time!

But, one day when you wake up in the morning, the thought comes to you that you
don't want to go to your favorite job. Each new day becomes a real torment. You
feel empty, powerless, apathetic, irritable. You practically stop sleeping.
Spoil the relationship with colleagues, who until recently were your favorite
team. You work on automatic, not seeing the sense in the actions, producing very
different results from what you expect from others. All of the above signs
indicate that you have emotional burnout. This is not laziness or lack of desire
to work. This is a disease, in 2019 included in the International Classification
of Diseases. Why does it arise? What is fraught with emotional burnout? How to
fight it and how to prevent it? These questions we will discuss further.

## What is emotional burnout

Officially, this term is interpreted as a syndrome that develops as a result of
accumulated chronic stress. It is a peculiar psychological defense mechanism
triggered in response to stress. Burnout is often faced by people who want to
succeed in all areas of life, so the diagnosis of emotional burnout is otherwise
called "the disease of excellent students", although it has nothing to do with
school, academic performance and even intellectual ability. This disease is
subject to representatives of social professions, a lot of contact with people:
doctors, psychologists, teachers, or caring for elderly relatives, children. On
their part, burnout manifests itself in the form of indifference to the growing
demands of management, negative reaction to the "whims" of patients or clients,
the emergence of a sense of failure, professional incompetence.

The process of emotional burnout consists of several stages. The more neglected
the condition is, the more difficult it is to overcome. In the absence of proper
treatment, you get serious chronic diseases dangerous for a person, such as
diabetes mellitus, diseases of cardiovascular system, digestive tract. You are
tormented by constant headaches, insomnia, depression. Career collapses and the
whole life goes downhill.

## Manifestations and signs

Burnout develops gradually when the body gradually runs out of vitality to cope
with stress. The manifestations of symptoms of emotional burnout can vary, but
often include fatigue, apathy and deterioration in professional performance. One
of the key manifestations of emotional burnout symptoms is a constant feeling of
fatigue and energy depletion. The first symptoms of burnout are subtle, so they
are easy to miss. Some of them manifest themselves periodically, but the
diagnosis of emotional burnout is made when the symptoms of the disease are
observed daily for a long time and constantly intensify. In general terms, they
can be described as follows:

- Exhaustion associated with overexertion, exhaustion of one's physical and
  emotional resources, accompanied by a constant feeling of fatigue from the
  very morning.

- Personal detachment, lack of emotion, lack of empathy for others.

- Emotional burnout is characterized by a sense of self worthlessness, decreased
  self-esteem.

The symptoms of burnout can be roughly divided into the following groups:

| **Physical**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Emotional**                                                                                                                                                            | **Behavioral**                                                                                                                                                                          | **Intelligent**                                                                                                               | **Social**                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Stages of emotional burnout

![why people burnout](/pochemu-lyudi-vygorayut-1024x682-1.webp)

Psychology distinguishes four stages of emotional burnout, described by the
German scientist Matthias Burisch:

- Increased self-demands, involvement in the process.

The success of any team depends on the performance and involvement of its
members. They should love their work, strive to do it well, increase their
performance against the background of other, more successful colleagues. But the
desire to be ahead, excessive love for work, desire for constant
self-development, creating "the best version of oneself" often plays a cruel
joke on people, causing burnout.

Sometimes working in an intensive mode is due to project requirements. But
periods of activity should be followed by quality, adequate rest to regain
energy. If you work late, then take extra courses, in between which you attend
trainings, without letting yourself relax and switch to neutral tasks - sooner
or later it will lead to burnout.

- Fatigue.

Increased self-demanding, constant heavy loads bring their "fruits". The body
reacts to them with physical and moral exhaustion. At this stage, a person feels
a lack of strength, his immunity decreases. He often gets colds, becomes
irritable, anxious.

Then you have trouble sleeping. You suffer from insomnia during the night, which
makes you feel sleepy and broken all the next day. Eating behavior is disturbed.
You want sweet, salty, fatty, calorie-rich food, or your appetite disappears
altogether.

- Decreased socialization.

At this stage, the person stops communicating with colleagues, relatives and
friends. Becomes embittered, cynical. Breaks off long-standing relationships,
deliberately limits the circle of communication.

- Disgust Syndrome.

It is accompanied by a feeling of apathy, hatred for everything around.
Depression and despondency appear. A person may even change in appearance: from
a stylish, needle-dressed fashionista with perfect hair to turn into a sloppy,
unkempt person with greasy, unkept hair. Nothing pleases him, does not arouse
interest. He sits for hours in one place, looking at one point. Work, hobbies,
family, personal life - everything goes "downhill". In severe cases, this stage
can end in a serious mental disorder or even suicide.

Joseph Greenberg's five-stage model provides a more detailed description of the
stages of emotional burnout:

| 1   | "Honeymoon"         | The employee works with enthusiasm, ready to perform any difficult tasks. But as the workload increases, he loses interest in his work.                         |
| --- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2   | "Lack of fuel"      | Fatigue appears, sleep is disturbed. Work discipline deteriorates: the employee is late, tries to leave early, is constantly on smoke breaks.                   |
| 3   | "Chronic symptoms"  | This stage is accompanied by aggression, irritability. The employee becomes less neat, does not follow the appearance (this is especially pronounced in women). |
| 4   | "Crisis"            | Chronic diseases occur. Partial or complete loss of working capacity. Self-esteem decreases, quality of life deteriorates.                                      |
| 5.  | "Punching the wall" | The problems listed above worsen, leading to serious disorders and the development of dangerous diseases.                                                       |

## Causes of emotional burnout

![Causes of emotional burnout](/prichiny-vygoraniya-1024x683-1.webp)

The causes of professional burnout are not always related to overwork or
intensive pace of life. Although there is even a stable expression about it:
"burned out at work". This process is more related to the peculiarities of
character, the ability to find a balance between work and personal life, the
quality of rest, the presence of a sense of satisfaction from life and work.

One of the common causes of burnout is devaluation. Not understanding the
purpose and usefulness of his activity, the employee feels not needed by the
company. This leads to a decrease in motivation, a drop in self-esteem, and the
development of the "impostor" or "loser" complex. Here is a simple example: you
are involved in a serious project, literally "burning" at work, devoting most of
your time to it. Then suddenly your bosses decide to cancel the project. The
reasons could be any: the customer has refused, the budget has been cut. Or when
the work was completed, the manager had no reaction to your efforts, not even a
thank you.

Non-payment of promised bonuses, unfair attitude on the part of immediate and
top management, banal lack of adequate response of the manager to the actions of
employees - all this also contributes to the onset of burnout.

Other causes of the syndrome:

- Unfavorable psychological environment in the team, with constant conflicts,
  bullying by colleagues;

- Inadequate, toxic executive;

- Psychological pressure from the company, with deliberate creation of
  unbearable working conditions;

Often from a very young age, parents, grandparents, or educators teach children
to "orient themselves to those around them."

"What will others think of you?"; "Listen to your elders - they know best what
to do", "Don't argue with the teacher - he is always right".

With such attitudes, the person will subconsciously try to please others without
taking into account his own capabilities, literally sacrificing himself to his
family, friends or work. At some point his resources will run out, and this will
lead to burnout. Therefore, it is important for those who work a lot with others
to take quality care of themselves.

The point is that by giving his strength and health to other people, a person
exhausts his mental and physical limit, becoming perpetually tired and
irritable. Thus, he loses his motivation and professionalism, becoming
unclaimed. To avoid such a situation, sometimes you need to stop in time,
switching to your own interests, not trying to help everyone. This will save
important resources for work and life, avoiding burnout.

## Differences from depression

Emotional burnout is sometimes wrongly compared to depression. The symptoms of
these conditions are indeed similar. But the approaches to overcoming them may
differ. Depression is a global condition affecting all spheres of a person's
life. Burnout is associated with his main activity: work, study or upbringing of
children. Differences between depression and burnout:

| Burnout                                                                          | Depression                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I'm a bad manager, I'm not doing a good job, my business is a useless endeavor.  | I'm a terrible husband, father, son, friend.                                                      |
| I'm given stupid tasks, partners are unbearable, coworkers are nasty.            | You can't trust anyone, all people are bad. They lie, pretend and cheat at the first opportunity. |
| I won't succeed, I'll lose money, my business will be taken away by competitors. | My life is meaningless, there's no future.                                                        |

Burnout can last for a long time, gradually becoming chronic. In the absence of
the necessary actions to overcome this condition, it turns into severe
depression. It is impossible to cope with this condition on one's own, it
requires medical treatment.
