Personnel management is one of the most important tasks facing the head of any
business. After all, the workforce of every organisation is an object that is
inextricably linked to the production process, profit, success, and the
company's authority.

Employees make a purposeful contribution to the rise or fall of production based
on their individual attitudes. Therefore, effective enterprise management should
always aim at non-stop growth in the productivity of the firm's workforce.

But how do you manage your company's workforce as productively as possible? What
exactly is labour team management? Does this area have peculiarities, goals and
objectives, strategies and possible mistakes? What is included in them and is a
priority? Is it possible to automate this process? We will answer these
questions in the article.

## Foundations of Organisational Personnel Management

People are the backbone of any socio-economic system, including small companies,
large firms and huge corporations. Whatever the business, its employees are its
main investment in training, hiring and then maintaining labour.

The head of the company should understand that personnel is the link on which
the level of productivity of the entire organisation directly depends. The
employees of the company are the main reason for the development and success of
the business. Therefore, personnel management is considered to be an activity
that is specifically aimed at the effective labour of the team in the company.

**The human resource management process includes components such as:**

- Drawing up a plan for the company's human resource needs.

- Placement and selection of employees.

- Organisation of work activities.

- Indicators of motivation and stimulation of labour of employees of the
  enterprise.

To manage labour resources means to ensure productive use of employees, when the
cost of the team is lower than its subsequent activity in the organisation. The
level of employee utilisation directly depends on the amount of funds invested
in creating the necessary conditions, including material and technical base,
organisation of a comfortable workplace and recreation, reproduction of the
labour resource.

Here also the pre-planning of the team is important. Before hiring employees,
several factors are taken into account, such as the number of employees, their
professional status, speciality, qualifications and assigned category.

Tracking the dynamics of the labour market environment significantly affects the
application of organisational methods, technologies, functions and objectives of
human resource management in a firm. For example, a negative demographic
situation in the country can lead to a shortage of workers, which plays an
important role in changing the motivation, incentives of work in all
organisations.

## Tasks of personnel management, what groups of tasks are included in this concept

The main objective of human resource management is considered to be the
productive utilisation of human resources in the long term. This requires
addressing a number of other equally important subtasks, which often include:

- generating and shaping the overall strategy;

- Determining the exact number of qualified employees, taking into account
  current enterprise team members;

- drawing up work schedules, writing job descriptions for each of the company's
  employees;

- fast closing of vacancies, staffing of the labour collective;

- Creating a talent pool from existing personnel for managerial positions;

- Reducing the risk of losing valuable employees;

- organisation of work taking into account the specifics of different
  workplaces;

- management of material costs for the labour force;

- analysing how well employees perform their duties;

- implementation of professional retraining programmes for the company's
  employees;

- development of personnel evaluation standards for future performance
  appraisals, inspections;

- Administering and enabling employees to move up the career ladder;

- motivation to work effectively.

In large companies and huge corporations, it is physically impossible for one
person to cope with all the main tasks. Therefore, the number of HR department
specialists in financially stable firms should be at least 1-1.2% of the total
number of the company's personnel.

## Principles of human resources management

The personnel administration mechanism is based on a number of critical
principles that cannot be overlooked when planning the allocation of labour
resources. For example, these include the following principles:

- selection of employees based on personal and professional qualities, character
  traits, and individual characteristics;

- the continuity of the working team, which consists in the organic combination
  of long-serving and newly arrived, inexperienced personnel;

- career advancement of employees, regular career growth on condition of quality
  performance;

- open competition, which consists of encouraging competition between employees
  applying for managerial seats and positions;

- the totality of trust in personnel and systematic control over the execution
  of orders in accordance with instructions, orders, acts, etc;

- matching the performer's capabilities and skills to the profession, projects,
  assigned work;

- auto-replacement of an employee who is sick or on leave;

- skill development;

- legal defence.

Thus, human resources must be managed through a coordinated approach across all
areas. This includes timely recruitment, appointment of management positions,
internships, etc.

## **Methods that help to manage staff**

Administration of any team is based on a whole set of methods of influence on
the employees of the organisation. It is necessary for the success of the
business, its efficient functioning in the market. In total, three main groups
of methods are distinguished in the personnel management system. They include
economic, administrative and socio-psychological. Let us briefly analyse the
structure of each group.

### **Economic**

This group includes all methods of material stimulation of the labour
collective. Among them, the most frequently used are such methods as personnel
participation in the distribution of profits received by the company, wage
increases, bonus payments for labour efficiency or quality, provision of social
support (free meals, medical insurance, payment for transport, etc.), penalties
and punishments in the form of deductions from wages.

### **Administrative**

These methods are based on the use of coercive measures and regulations from the
Labour Code of the Russian Federation by the company's management team.
Therefore, they include all orders, instructions and directives calling for
compliance with labour discipline. They often imply certain responsibility of
the employee for certain industrial offences.

The key feature is the immediate nature of the impact, immediate execution or
putting into action the order, instruction of the management.

### **Socio-psychological**

Impact methods based on the basic knowledge of principles in the field of
sociology and psychology also play a significant role. They can minimise the
number of debates, disputes and conflicts in the team, create a strong corporate
culture, and manage career development, qualifications, skills and abilities of
employees.

Moreover, these aspects help to identify informal leaders of the work team,
determine the place of personnel in the team, and instantly resolve various
clashes and quarrels between workers.

## Human resources management strategies

Competitive, reliable and friendly staff of the organisation in theory and in
practise achieves the goals set by the management if the team has a common
concept of the organisation's development, i.e. a certain strategy with a clear
content.

All HR management strategies are characterised by two criteria: long-term and
close connection with the general concept of the company's development.
Therefore, the five strategies currently used in the most developed modern
corporations are considered to be the most effective: entrepreneurial, dynamic
growth, profitability, liquidation and circulation. Let us consider each of them
in more detail.

### **Entrepreneurial**

Suitable for organisations that are engaged in a new type of activity. It is
distinguished by the selection of personnel with risk-taking skills, initiative,
contact and long-term co-operation orientation. Assumes competitive salaries and
bonuses, evaluates on actual labour results. Trains the team in an informal,
on-the-job setting and is often characterised by mentoring. Also promotes
employees in their careers, taking into account their interests.

### **Dynamic growth**

It has low risks, lays a strong foundation for further development of the firm,
makes decisions based on a combination of goals and the means required to
achieve them. It is characterised by the selection of the most loyal and
flexible personnel who are able to take risks when necessary. Provides for fair
bonus remuneration, evaluates labour according to predetermined criteria. It
emphasises the development of each employee in the area of the core business.
Plans reshuffle in the organisation taking into account corporate opportunities,
and practices various forms of promotion.

### **Profitability**

Suitable for enterprises that aim to maintain the existing level of profit. It
is characterised by strict selection of personnel. Provides for monetary
remuneration of employees based on professional merits, seniority and internal
ideas of fairness. Stakes on concrete results and personal development. Plans
personnel changes based on the company management's perception of expediency.

### **Liquidations**

It is used in corporations that sell assets to eliminate losses, plan to reduce
staff due to falling profits. Characterised by unlikely recruitment of new
employees. Provides for essentially merit-based pay with little or no increase
and no incentives. Has a strict evaluation of employee performance according to
managerial criteria. Develops and trains staff only when there is an acute
business need. Promotes only those employees who have the skills and concepts
required for the job.

### **Circles**

It is used to save the company, which often entails drastic staff reductions. It
is characterised by the selection of employees with versatile development and
high qualifications. Pays according to a system of incentives and merit checks.
Evaluates labour on the basis of performance. Trains employees only after
careful selection. Promotes employees in various forms.

## The main mistakes in personnel management

The fierce competition in the labour market does not allow modern companies to
make mistakes in the process of personnel management, as it makes it very
difficult to create a cohesive and friendly team of employees in the
institution. Let's look in more detail at some of the mistakes that make team
building impossible.

### **Management's indifference to the team**

Indifference encourages experienced workers to quit and new workers not to stay
with the company. High staff turnover leads to high training costs and reduced
profitability due to a shortage of labour.

### **Unsuitable working conditions at the enterprise**

Weak material and technical base, lack of Internet access, inadequate social
guarantees (medical care, provision of sanatorium and spa treatment, small
salaries, etc.) also force employees to quit in search of a better place of
work.

### **Lack of career prospects and opportunities**

This mistake is most often manifested in budgetary state organisations, where it
is impossible to get a promotion without 5-10 years of service. Beginning
specialists with ambitions are frightened by low salaries in the first years of
work and prefer to leave for other companies where career is built on activity,
initiative and quality performance of tasks.

### **Spontaneous recruitment**

Lack of certain job requirements, unclear functionality and tasks also make
staff agonise over a new job and then leave for more understandable competitors.

### **Lack of a selection strategy**

Staff should be recruited on the spot in accordance with corporate ethics, goals
and objectives, and the organisation's strategy. If these are absent, the
collective has no opportunity to become a cohesive team. In addition, when the
system of requirements, standards and rules is constantly changing, the work
also becomes unbearable.

### **Inadequate assessment of a candidate for a position**

Requirements for candidates should be reasonable and clear. Discrimination
should not be used on any grounds, such as appearance (girls under 25, model
appearance, certain height, etc.).

### **Underestimated or overestimated requirements for a candidate for a position**

Each specific position implies practical experience. You should not take a
highly qualified specialist for a vacancy that is too easy, as he will waste
skills and lose interest in the business and work. Nor should you take people
without experience to a responsible position, as this threatens the firm with
losses: profits, clients, orders, etc.

### **Misinforming the candidate**

Deliberately withholding information about the full range of responsibilities,
reward and punishment system, salary, etc. during the interview threatens the
employee's quick departure from the position, which again entails turnover and
regular training costs for new employees.

There are other mistakes that a company may make in the process of personnel
management. For example, incorrect setting of tasks, making unclear demands,
loss of control over subordinates, violation of subordination, insufficient
recognition of employees' merits to the organisation, negative attitude towards
the company's employees. They severely undermine the authority of the
organisation, push staff away from the management and the firm as a whole, and
force them to look for a new place of work.
