Any organization can be compared to a complex mechanism consisting of people,
equipment and business processes. In order for such a multi-tiered structure to
work smoothly, properly, like clockwork, each of its elements needs to be
directed and controlled. To do this, it is worth implementing regulations - a
set of rules describing the actions of subdivisions, departments, each employee
within the framework of the enterprise. Compliance with regulations ensures the
consistency of the company's work. It gets rid of routine, allowing you to focus
on important strategic issues. We will try to understand the meaning and some
types of regulations in this article.

## What it is and why a company needs it

![What is regulations](/leadesaq-1024x610-1.webp)

A regulation is a document containing a set of rules, procedures and
instructions describing the activities of employees in an organization. Clear
guidelines are developed for each position:

- What kind of work the employee does;

- Who he is in charge of and who he reports to;

- What reports, and in what timeframes provides to management.

It is one of the main documents of the manager that is being developed:

- For a structural subdivision of an organization (department, workshop). In
  this case, it helps to divide the areas of responsibility between separate
  teams involved in common business processes. Each of them performs its own
  tasks without asking the management for instructions and clarifications.

- For each performer in the team. It is a detailed instruction that defines the
  order and sequence of individual functions or processes of an employee.
  Includes explanations of how to properly perform certain production
  operations, for example: make a sales report, plan, conduct inventory in the
  warehouse.

Implementation of regulations greatly simplifies company management and makes
the work of its employees organized and understandable. Despite the fact that
its development takes quite a lot of time, requires focus and close attention to
detail from the manager, its implementation pays for itself in full.

## Benefits of implementation

Work regulations are necessary for organizations whose employees have
difficulties in mastering uniform work processes. They constantly turn to their
superiors, ask questions related to functionality, and the manager has to be
distracted from his direct duties to explain each process in detail. To make
such activities simple, understandable for each participant in the organization,
regulations are needed. Its other advantages:

- Standardization of activities. Means that unspoken rules become mandatory for
  everyone. They are observed by top managers, the CEO, and all executives.

- Procedures become consistent. By following routines that describe each step of
  a task, employees make fewer mistakes by following a ready-made pattern or
  example. This has a positive impact on the speed, quality of activities,
  bringing profit to the organization.

- Quick adaptation of new employees, reducing their training costs.

- Reducing dependence on "star" employees. The team should not suffer because of
  the departure of one or two performers. With detailed instructions from the
  regulations in front of them, the new member will quickly get up to speed and
  work as well as his predecessor.

- Prompt correction of errors arising due to the "human factor".

- Increased satisfaction and quality of customer relations as a result of
  reduced rejects. Contractors perform their duties based on requirements and
  standards. Therefore, they clearly understand what the end customer needs as a
  result.

- Improved communication between individual departments. Colleagues know where
  to go to get signatures for invoices, so they don't waste time traveling
  endlessly through offices.

The Regulations provide clear answers to the most common questions concerning
the activities of the organization. The Regulations facilitate mutual
understanding between the management, the organization and its structural
elements. It helps to timely detect and promptly eliminate errors arising in the
work. The Regulations ensure quick on-the-job training of new employees.

## Regulations in the company's legal system

![How to write regulations](/sostavlenye-reglamenta-1024x580-1.webp)

The manager must decide which position in the organization is to be regulated.
It makes more sense to start with the job that brings direct profit to the
organization, i.e., salespeople. Or the job in which employees make the most
mistakes and errors.

Conventionally, this task is divided into several stages:

### Preparatory

1. Appointment of persons responsible for drafting the document.

2. Discussing the upcoming process with the implementers to incorporate their
   interests and suggestions.

3. Involvement of experienced staff in the development of guidelines and
   standards.

4. Scheduling meetings to oversee development.

### Goal setting

Determine what area of activity the instruction will govern. Here are some
options:

1. Standardization of processes with the development of uniform standards for
   all its departments.

2. Optimization of the company's operations (increasing productivity, reducing
   bloated staff, improving processes).

3. Improving the quality of products (services), reducing scrap and industrial
   accidents.

4. Establishing effective interrelationships between departments.

### Approval of the form

The document must contain the following information:

1. Name of Organization.

2. Document Name.

3. Unique number, date, place of creation.

4. Name of approving authority, date of approval.

5. Signatures of the persons agreeing to the document.

### Table of Contents

1. Introduction. It specifies the objectives, purpose, scope of application of
   the document. This section also contains information on the persons
   responsible for its development, approval and compliance.

2. General Provisions. Describes the tasks for which the regulation was
   developed, as well as all the rules, standards, and requirements that
   employees must comply with. In addition, the section specifies the procedures
   for adopting and repealing the regulations.

3. Purpose. Brief description of the regulated process.

4. Scope. This contains information about the objects, processes involved.

5. Terms, definitions.

6. Regulatory references to laws, basic documents in force in the industry.

11. Instructions for employees and individual units.

12. Procedure for making clarifications, amendments to the document.

13. Appendices in the form of reference books, charts, forms, tables, other
    additional information necessary for the preparation of relevant
    documentation.

### Harmonization

The final draft of the regulations is approved after discussion with the
company's employees, management and investors. After the document has been
approved, the manager issues the relevant order. From that moment on, the
organization works in accordance with the approved regulations.

### Formalization

Structure information using bulleted lists. Use headings, sections and
subsections for clear presentation of information. Write in the regulations a
system of links for quick access to different sections of the document. Keep the
final version in a non-editable format to protect it from accidental or
deliberate changes, so that only a certain number of people can edit the
document.

## Rules for the application of regulations

![Rules for the application of regulations](/primenenye-reglamentov-1024x627-1.webp)

All employees must be familiarized with the document. For this purpose, an
attestation is organized or signatures are collected from employees stating that
they undertake to comply with the requirements set out in the regulations. It is
important that each performer understands what is required of him. If the
document is written in complex language, it should be simplified, rid of
unnecessary water and clericalisms. The information in it should be presented in
an accessible and understandable form.

To check the implementation of the regulations, a system of reports is
developed, meetings are held with the participation of employees and managers,
and control programs are installed on employees' computers. To ensure that the
implementation of regulations does not cause rejection among the performers,
they should have detailed instructions in hand. Work without violations should
be encouraged. In case of problems or disputes, employees should be able to
contact technical support.
