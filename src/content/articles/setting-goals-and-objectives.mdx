For successful development, it is important to set the right goals. They are a
reflection of our dreams. It is important to formulate and formulate goals
correctly, because they motivate to perform actions, active, conscious actions.
This is a kind of internal resource that helps to overcome obstacles, not to
give up in front of difficulties in difficult moments.

Let's try to understand how goal setting helps in business and life. What should
be taken into account when setting goals? How does competent goal-setting
contribute to the efficiency of companies and managers? Let's analyze these and
other questions in detail, review the basic rules and techniques of goal
setting, and talk about current approaches, methods, and principles of goal
setting.

## What it is

A goal is a model of an ideal future. The result you want to achieve. Buy a new
car, lose 10 kilograms by summer, take your company to an international level.
All of the above are goals that require certain actions. When we set a goal, we
ask ourselves the question: "What to do?" And the question of how to do it
correctly is answered by the tasks performed along the way.

The ability to achieve goals helps to improve self-organization. It makes a
person stress-resistant and self-confident. A properly set goal helps to
separate major and minor tasks. Effectively distribute efforts for their
fulfillment, excluding useless waste of time.

## Areas of a person's life for goal setting

People set goals in different spheres of life. They can be divided into 10
types:

| Health                   | Activities aimed at improving physical health (sports, proper nutrition, active lifestyle)                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Family                   | Building relationships with loved ones                                                                                       |
| Relationship with others | Communication and cooperation with colleagues, management, friends and acquaintances                                         |
| Career                   | Everything related to business development and running a business                                                            |
| Education                | Obtaining a university diploma, certificate of advanced training, additional or special education                            |
| Material situation       | Proper distribution of financial flows                                                                                       |
| Public life              | Participation in public organizations, events, charity and volunteer activities                                              |
| Spirituality             | Formation of world outlook, definition of spiritual values                                                                   |
| Personal development     | Overcoming negative qualities by introducing useful habits into life, performing humane and noble deeds, learning new skills |

After analyzing the listed areas, they are given scores from 0 to 10 on a
10-point scale. In this way, it is possible to determine which points should be
paid more attention to in order to increase satisfaction and quality of life.

## Methods of goal setting

![Methods of goal setting](/principy-planirovaniyya-1024x479.webp)

Having made a hierarchy of values, we need to find out which of them are in
conflict with each other. In what way it can be resolved. The following ways of
goal-setting can be used for the search:

- Intuition.

- Invention.

- Calculation.

- Choice and prescription.

The first method is "automatically built in" in every person. The algorithm of
goal-setting in this case is extremely simple and clear. To understand what you
need, you need to listen to your inner voice and life experience.

Invention is an experimental process based on achieving a certain result in the
foreseeable future. For example, you can't decide on a hobby. So you decide to
try your hand at embroidery or scrapbooking. After attending classes for a
while, you can make the right conclusion: whether this activity is right for you
or whether you should try something else.

Using the calculation method, identify the key objective. It is written down on
a sheet of paper or digital media. Under the main goal are placed smaller ones
that will help to fulfill the main dream. These in turn are evaluated according
to the following criteria:

- Achievement time.

- Complexity of execution.

- Choice Opportunity.

The best option is given a high score (4). The problematic and costly one is
given a low score (up to 1). After calculating the sums of the obtained values,
more realistic and profitable ways of implementation are determined. This method
is rather cumbersome and complicated in execution. Therefore, it is practically
not used in everyday life.

Using the prescriptive method, they choose one goal for themselves from the
existing benchmarks proposed by someone else. They draw up a step-by-step
instruction for achieving it. As an example, we can cite a case from the life of
an ordinary family raising a school graduate. His mother sees him as a
journalist, his father recommends choosing a career as a lawyer, and his
grandfather and grandmother believe that he will achieve better success if he
becomes a doctor. The young man can choose one of the options offered. Or he can
follow his own path.

## How to set achievable goals

![How to set achievable goals](/planirovanie-raboty-menedzhera-1024x372.webp)

Many people set goals for themselves for the New Year. But, only a small
percentage fulfills the intended. Various methods are used to clarify their
rationality. For example, setting goals and objectives using SMART technology.
According to this method, the goal should be clearly described, measurable,
achievable, commensurate with other goals and limited in time. Let us consider
these criteria in more detail:

- **Specific** implies being as close to reality as possible. The goal should
  accurately describe the result to be achieved. If we are talking about
  improving the quality of employee labor, the specific goal is to increase
  productivity by 40% by the second quarter of this year. In order to achieve
  this target, the company will automate production.

- **Measurable** means the ability to present the result obtained in any unit of
  measurement. If you plan to become a popular blogger, an approximate goal
  would be to increase the number of subscribers to a specific figure, for
  example, 10,000.

- **Achivieable** is the belief that the goal can be realized. Analysis of ways
  to achieve it. If you want to become a software market leader, you need to be
  able to competently promote and sell the developed product. Lead a team of
  experienced specialists. Team members should be "on the same wavelength" with
  you. Understand what benefits they will get if you achieve a positive result.

- **Relevant** is proven by its relevance to the company. It should not be
  imposed from above or stolen from a competitor. The goal should be a result
  that brings real benefit to you.

- **Time bound** assumes that the goal has a schedule of milestones and an end
  date.

A brief deciphering of the SMART mechanism can be described as follows:

1. Maximizing Specificity of Results (S).

2. Presence of measured and analyzed indicators (M).

3. Achievability Assessment (A).

4. Necessity, Importance, and Relevance (R).

5. Due Date (T).

The search for and formulation of personal goals is influenced by many factors:
family, social environment, mass media, and so on. But the responsibility for
them lies with the person himself.

## Signs and tools to achieve the goals

![Signs and tools to achieve the goals](/plan-proekta-1024x342.webp)

Using different ways of setting a goal, it is important to understand at what
point the desired result can be considered achieved. It is not enough to want to
buy a car. It will be yours only at the moment when you receive the title deed
to the vehicle.

Various tools can be used to achieve the intended goal. The most common tools
include:

### Countdown

List the key steps of the plan from the last to the first. Describe the steps
that need to be taken to achieve them. Each of them is given a deadline.
Example:

Goal: Move into a new apartment by October 2024.

- What does it take to move into an apartment? Finish the renovation (by October
  2024).

- What do you need to complete the renovation? Interior finish (September 2024).

- What does it take to complete the finish? Hire a crew, purchase materials
  (July 2024).

- Materials Procurement (June 2024).

- Finding a repair crew (May 2024).

That is, the first step is to select a construction crew and sign a contract for
repair work.

### Daily activities

It is mandatory to perform one or more activities each day to accomplish the
work of the overall goal. This should be done on a regular basis.

### Suitable environment

Make your life the most fulfilling and interesting. Getting new knowledge,
communicating with successful, educated people, you will always remember your
goal. For its successful realization it is very important to have the support of
your relatives and the help of qualified specialists.

### Self-hypnosis

This tool should be used by those who believe in the materiality of thoughts.
Visualize your dream. Visualize and capture yourself at the moment of achieving
it. It can be a drawing, a presentation or a collage of photos. Modeling the
feeling of possessing what you want, you will get moral strength for new
achievements, you will want to make more efforts.

## Common mistakes that prevent you from achieving your goal

![mistakes](/what-about-scrum-1024x479.webp)

The main obstacle on the way to the dream is the unwillingness to face negative
emotions. Unpreparedness for change, fear of failure - it deprives you of
strength and prevents you from moving forward. To become successful in business
and life, it is important to be sure that you can always find a way out of any
situation. Proper goal-setting implies active actions. Among the frequent
mistakes that do not allow you to achieve the desired result, it is worth
highlighting:

- **Insecurity**. It does not allow you to open up, to fully utilize your
  capabilities and inner resources. It becomes a reason for endless postponement
  of important things "for later". You can get rid of this negative factor by
  concentration. Acquisition of life and professional experience.

- **Fuzzy wording**. Without knowing what you want, you won't be able to focus
  on the main objectives. This means that key goals will not be achieved.

- **Failure to be serious**. If you set a goal, you will have to constantly work
  to fulfill it. Without active, balanced, competent actions, the result will be
  zero.

- **Lack of desire to work on yourself**. Passing in front of difficulties on
  the way to the fulfillment of dreams, you will tread on the same place and
  will not achieve anything in life. Only constant striving for self-improvement
  and development will give a positive result.

- **Lack of self-control and reminder system**. Sometimes it's hard to keep
  everything in your head. Especially with a large number of tasks and errands.
  Therefore, it is convenient to use special universal programs - task
  managers - to organize your own time and review your goals.

- **Exaggerated demands**. Achieving the ideal is difficult. This does not mean
  that you should not strive for it. However, feeling guilt or regret at a
  negative result is also not worth it. It is necessary to analyze the
  situation, analyze the mistakes and make a new attempt.

- **Lack of a team of like-minded people**. It is impossible to cope with all
  the problems alone. The support of relatives, teamwork, understanding and
  friendly attitude of colleagues are important for accomplishing the set goal.

- **Lack of a contingency plan**. It is necessary for prompt corrections to the
  set tasks.

- **Complete abandonment of the intended in case of failure**.

If you get a negative result, you should not despair. It is impossible to
foresee all the pitfalls and obstacles. In this case, it is good to have a
backup plan with carefully worked out actions to overcome the situation.

## What will help you achieve your goal

You can achieve what you want faster by focusing on what is important. Movement
towards the goal should be constant and regular. Steps can be tiny, even
microscopic, but they must be made daily, without stopping. Visualize and
designate your intention in a positive coloring. Set clear and measurable goals.
Track their fulfillment every step of the way. Don't be afraid to ask for help
and start over. And most importantly, believe in yourself and your abilities.
