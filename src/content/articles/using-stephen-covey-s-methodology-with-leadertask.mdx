"It's important to prioritize." This phrase is a leitmotif in most works on time
management, penetrating deeper and deeper into the consciousness of everyone who
seeks to master this science. Any specialist in the field of time management
knows that wrongly defined priorities can bring to naught not only all efforts
to organize and plan the working day, but also significantly complicate life in
general. Except that "knowing" doesn't always mean "being able to". Simple
awareness of this leading principle of time management is sometimes not enough
to learn how to prioritize correctly, and people begin to ask themselves, "How
do I know what's really important?".

Stephen Covey, a renowned expert on efficiency and internal resource management,
has tried to help his readers understand this difficult topic with the books
First Things First and Focus: Achieving Your Highest Priorities. In these works,
the author describes his method of organizing time to achieve maximum efficiency
and at the heart of his system is also based on the concept of priorities, which
is not just involved in the process, but literally permeates every step on the
path of improving self-organization. Stephen Covey in his books gives a detailed
typology of existing priorities, offers the most successful systems of criteria,
provides signs, features and examples of how to correctly define them.

Of course, Stephen Covey's system is not limited to prioritization alone and
includes a full range of techniques for effective planning. In order to apply
this system more successfully in practice, it is worth using additional tools,
such as electronic organizers. The most suitable choice is LeaderTask planner.
This program was developed with consideration of the implementation of complex
and multi-level time management systems and due to its flexibility and
versatility will perfectly cope with the duties of an assistant in the process
of planning things according to the methodology of Stephen Covey.

## 1\. Destination formula

The key aspect of Stephen Covey's system is the purpose formula. It determines
all the subsequent features of the planning process, allows a person to identify
the main directions of his activities, the goals he sets for himself and the
functions to be performed for this purpose. In fact, the formula of purpose
remotely resembles the mission of the enterprise, which sooner or later has to
be formed by any businessman. According to Stephen Covey's theory, the purpose
formula is a description of the most important benchmarks and goals on your life
path. It can be written in the form of a detailed list of principles or, on the
contrary, in the form of a short and concise phrase. You can also write it on a
piece of paper or in a text file. But you should take into account that Stephen
Covey recommends that you review, analyze and evaluate your purpose formula on a
weekly basis, so it is desirable to have it handy.

The "Notes" tool that LeaderTask organizer offers you is designed for such
notes. By transferring your notes to the computer planner, you can be sure that
your data will be safe and sound thanks to the backup function. And also you
will always be able to quickly find the information you need. It is worth adding
that the organizer has a wide range of text formatting options that will allow
you to highlight key points, emphasize important notes or illustrate any note.

On the basis of the formed formula of purpose you can identify the main roles
that you would like to fulfill in your life. Each role should have its own
purpose. You can create a list of roles and their goals next to the purpose
formula.

## 2\. Roles

Organizing time according to Stephen Covey's methodology suggests that any task
written into the plan relates to a specific role, reflecting one area of your
life.

In LeaderTask organizer it is easy to implement this by creating labels for each
role in the navigator.

In doing so, Stephen Covey recommends forming contextual goals for roles that
will answer the questions "What?", "Why?" and "How?" you do while in a
particular role.

Special attention should be paid to the role of "sharpening the saw". It is
mandatory for everyone and is a process of increasing your capabilities and
abilities in various areas of your life, organized along its dimensions. Stephen
Covey explains this role as follows: "We are often so busy 'sawing' (producing
results) that we forget to 'sharpen the saw' (maintaining and enhancing our
ability to produce results in the future)."

## 3\. The four human needs

Stephen Covey believes that human life is lived in four dimensions: physical,
social, intellectual and spiritual. These dimensions are respectively revealed
in the following needs: to live, to love, to learn and to leave a mark.

Every role you fulfill in life exists in all four dimensions, which are
intimately interconnected and generate powerful synergies.

In the planning process, you need to monitor and, most importantly, analyze the
degree to which your needs are filled at each stage leading to the achievement
of your goals. To bring these four life dimensions into the process of time
organization you can use the "Projects" section in LeaderTask organizer. After
creating the necessary elements, you will be able to assign each task to a
certain type of need, which will allow you to quickly select only those that
belong to the required dimension or their combination among the list of tasks.

## 4\. Markers for tasks according to their priorities

The basis of Stephen Covey's system is the Time Management Matrix. It reflects
four basic levels of prioritization of tasks for a person in terms of urgency
and importance.

![](/Steven-coveys-time-management-matrix.webp)

According to the author of the matrix, for successful and effective activity
most of the tasks (65-80%) should be concentrated in Quadrant II. Only
performing important but not urgent tasks will allow you to achieve the desired
results and enjoy the process of realizing your life goals. Tasks from the other
quadrants, in their turn, bring inconvenience and unpleasant feelings, introduce
elements of chaos into your life plan and make you put off really important
things for later.

At first glance, it may seem that only Quadrant II cases should be included in
the plan and other priorities should be left out. But this can only be realistic
under ideal conditions, when the human factor is removed from the equation of
life. In reality, however, we interact with other people on a daily basis,
struggle with our weaknesses, and fulfill our responsibilities, whatever they
may be. Therefore, when planning your workday you need to consider all four
quadrants and prioritize them honestly, first and foremost to yourself. In the
future, this will allow you to analyze your affairs and determine your quadrant
ratio.

To apply the Time Management Matrix in the LeaderTask organizer, there is a
"Tags" guide. Here you can create elements corresponding to each of the
quadrants and choose their design. Assigning tags to tasks will allow you not
only to visually determine the degree of importance and urgency of tasks, but
also to sort the list of tasks by priority level.

In addition to the basic prioritization system based on the Time Management
Matrix, Stephen Covey recommends detailing the levels of importance of tasks
using the ABC method, assigning a letter to each task. Thus, a task labeled with
the letter A has the highest priority. The letter B means the average importance
of the case. And C tasks are characterized by a low degree of importance or
urgency. In a large flow of cases you can further detail the priority of cases
by entering numerical designations: A1, A2, …, B1, B2, …, C1, C2, …, C1, C2, …

Using the ABC method or its extended variation in practical activities can be
easily implemented with the LeaderTask organizer. To do this, you just need to
add the required letter and number to the beginning of the task and the program
will sort the tasks by importance. LeaderTask's task sorting mechanism is
ideally suited for implementing Stephen Covey's priority system; tasks can be
sorted by markers.

## 5\. Decision-making framework

In his works, Stephen Covey repeatedly emphasizes that planning should begin
with Quadrant II activities, i.e. important but not urgent activities that bear
the juiciest fruit. To illustrate the process with this principle in mind, the
author uses a favorite example of time management experts, the story of the hard
fate of water, sand, pebbles and large stones. In this case, the big stones
reflect the key matters corresponding to Quadrant II, and the small things
characterize the other degrees of importance and urgency. The essence of the
approach is that the first thing to do is to create a framework for the working
day or week using the big and important task stones, and only then build the
rest of the plan around them.

It is worth paying special attention to the process of setting deadlines, which
is an inevitable companion of any planning system.

In LeaderTask organizer, you can define deadlines for tasks using several
methods.

You can simply drag a task to the agenda area for the required period and it
will be automatically assigned the corresponding date and time. The method of
moving tasks in the agenda is suitable when you plan the next days quickly, as
well as when you add pre-created tasks (e.g. from the "maybe" list) to the plan.

Or you can set the date and time of the task using the Deadline dialog box. This
method is more convenient for precise planning, setting long deadlines or the
frequency of task repetitions.

In addition, when planning the schedule of a particular day, you can filter the
data by date using the Filter toolbar or the Mini Calendar. After that you just
need to create a task by typing its name in the task tree and it will be
automatically assigned the date by which the filtering was performed. This
option is preferable for long-term planning.

Stephen Covey in his paper planner offers two zones for writing things down. The
first zone is for tasks that have specific deadlines, and the second zone is for
the current day's priority list, i.e. tasks that should be done today when there
is time for them.

LeaderTask organizer also provides such an opportunity to its users, which once
again confirms the program's compliance with Stephen Covey's methodology. The
list of current tasks that have not yet been assigned a specific time is located
at the top of the calendar. In this electronic planner you can create long-term
tasks that will take more than one day to complete. These tasks are also located
above the timeline and are labeled with arrows to indicate that the deadline for
the task extends beyond the current day.

As mentioned above, case planning should be implemented primarily based on the
tasks from Quadrant II.

## 6\. Weekly update

Concentrating on business and worries, you should never forget about rest, as it
is a full-fledged component of any plan. That is why Stephen Covey recommends
paying special attention to weekends as a logical continuation of the working
week. At the same time, being in close connection with the weekdays, the
weekends must necessarily be different, only under this condition will be the
much-needed renewal. Of course, this does not mean that you should devote your
weekends to Quadrant IV. It is enough to simply switch your activities to a
different mode and engage in tasks from the same Quadrant II, but more suitable
for the weekend atmosphere.

LeaderTask electronic planner also tries to take care of your updating. That is
why weekends and non-working hours are highlighted with a different shade in the
program, so that you can immediately determine that this area belongs to the
sphere of rest and you need a different approach and things of a different
nature.

Taking into account that work schedule can be quite individual LeaderTask
organizer offers its users to define the duration of working hours and days of
the week related to weekends by themselves in case of non-standard situations.

## 7\. Scale of the week

Stephen Covey singles out the week as the most appropriate, even ideal, period
of time. Suitable for everything. According to the author, a week is easy to
plan, weekly performance is easy to analyze, regular weekly tasks give good
results, but do not become a routine duty that burdens a person.

Thus, according to Stephen Covey's methodology, a week is the key planning
period, its basis. Using LeaderTask computer planner, you can easily perform
weekly planning by switching to the appropriate calendar display mode.

This will result in a 7-day area displaying the days of the week from Monday
through Sunday.

To make planning more comfortable, LeaderTask scheduler provides an option to
expand the agenda area to the entire workspace using the buttons located on the
border between the task tree and calendar. You can also hide the navigator in
the View menu.

Working according to Stephen Covey's system, you will often have to review the
list of tasks planned for the current or next week. And when the list of tasks
is large, there is a desire to get only the list of tasks related to a
particular week, excluding everything irrelevant at the moment. This is why
LeaderTask organizer provides an opportunity to filter tasks by certain time
intervals. To do this, you need to select the days you need in the calendar.

Filtering by pre-created parameters is performed using the "Filter" toolbar.

## 8\. Backup time zones

When telling his readers about the process of assigning tasks on a timeline,
Stephen Covey notes that it is undesirable to make a clear second-by-second plan
for the entire day. The author recommends leaving free time and focusing on the
concept of creating a flexible plan. This will allow you to react faster and
much more calmly to sudden crisis or urgent tasks, because such situations in
most cases will not be able to significantly disrupt your plans and will
probably fit into the "air" in the schedule reserved by you in advance. If
critical events do not occur, you can always occupy the remaining time with
useful things from Quadrant II.

Stephen Covey also introduces the concept of time zones for important tasks,
which reserve time in the plan for one or another area of your life without
detailing the tasks to be performed. Most often these are repetitive activities
for which free time is reserved in advance. For example, playing sports three
times a week. So, it can be a trip to the pool, and exercises in the gym, or
maybe playing football with your child in the yard. In any case, it will be
physical exercise and time should be reserved in advance.

To create a regular task in LeaderTask organizer, you need to use the familiar
"Deadline" dialog box. Here, using flexible repetition settings, you can set the
required frequency of the task.

It should be emphasized that when working according to Stephen Covey's system,
you will have to refer to the frequency of tasks more than once. The author
recommends weekly analyzing, evaluating and revising your activities and the
basic elements of planning, such as the purpose formula, roles and goals. In
addition, you should make it a habit to make a weekly plan for the following
week and adjust it daily according to your current circumstances. It is better
to determine the time for these activities in advance and reserve it with the
help of a periodic task. When exactly to conduct weekly planning, on Friday at
the end of the working day or on Sunday before the upcoming work week, Stephen
Covey suggests that you choose for yourself, but the fact that this planning is
necessary and, most importantly, effective leaves no doubt.

It is worth noting that the type of periodic tasks also includes most of the
things you do as a "sharpening saw". These are educational tasks, updating
procedures, physical exercises, in general, anything that allows you to maintain
and increase your inner resources to reach new heights.

## 9\. Symbols

In the audio version of the seminar "Focus. In the audio version of the seminar
"Focus" the listener is introduced to the subtleties of working with the current
plan with the help of special designations, the list of which is given in the
FranklinCovey paper organizer. For example, to indicate that a case is in
progress and to quickly find the latest work project after a forced shift of
focus, you need to put a dot next to the task. A tick marks a completed case. An
arrow sign means that the task is postponed, and a cross means that it is
canceled.

The list of standard preset statuses in LeaderTask electronic organizer fully
corresponds to this list of characters.

In addition to the above statuses, Stephen Covey's methodology suggests using a
certain sign (a circle) to indicate delegated tasks that have been assigned to
another person, but have not yet been completed and are waiting for feedback. In
LeaderTask organizer you can see the statuses of both your own tasks and
delegated tasks.

Another auxiliary sign can be a task label for the "**maybe**" list. The tasks
on this list are not even goals, not deeds, but just ideas. They may never be
realized, but they may become a key element of your life, so you can't put it on
the to-do list, but you don't want to lose it in your memory either. Stephen
Covey recommends immediately assigning tasks on the "**maybe**" list to a
specific role. To distinguish such an idea from the to-do list, you should
assign a "**maybe**" label to it. Tags are defined in the corresponding handbook
and can be attached to tasks.

## 10\. Four dimensions of the role

As it was written above, each role is realized in all four needs: to live, to
love, to learn and to leave a mark. At the same time, these dimensions are
closely related to each other and can overlap or overlap. This relationship is
reflected in LeaderTask organizer due to the possibility of multiple assignment
of tags and projects, as well as due to the distribution of these concepts in
different sections. Thus, you can assign several roles and projects to one task
at the same time. In the future, this feature will allow you to build the
necessary task lists more precisely and correctly using the filtering tool.
Thus, one task can refer to the roles of saw sharpening, student and teacher
simultaneously reflecting both spiritual and intellectual dimensions.

## 11\. Filtration

In his writings, Stephen Covey devotes much of his attention to the importance
of balance between roles and between the dimensions of life. Only if you achieve
balance in all the important areas of your activities will you be able to
achieve success. All aspects, phenomena, aspirations and goals are closely
linked. So, if the role of "Leader" is realized and the role of "Father" is
neglected, you will not receive a positive response from your own self and you
will not be able to say with a light heart that your life is perfect. Stephen
Covey emphasizes the "and" conjunction between roles. This applies to the
balance of needs as well.

The corresponding logic is embedded in the filtering algorithm that LeaderTask
organizer is equipped with. In addition, the flexible toolkit allows you to
create complex, multi-criteria queries to get detailed task lists.

For example, you can use the Filter toolbar to generate a to-do list related
only to the "maybe" list for a specific role, or consider important tasks
related only to job roles and their physical dimension.

## 12\. Four gifts

Stephen Covey writes that there are four abilities in response to four human
needs: self-awareness, conscience, creative imagination, and independent will.
Working with these gifts depends to a large extent on you and your inner
disposition. But even here LeaderTask electronic organizer can become useful and
help you realize the ways of their development.

Thus, one of the ways to interact with self-awareness Stephen Covey calls
keeping a personal diary, which you can organize as a note in the LeaderTask
scheduler. The ability to automatically insert the date will greatly facilitate
the process of filling out the diary.

The development of conscience is based on reading relevant literature. This does
not include specialized publications on your profession. These should be "wise"
books that can make you think about important philosophical phenomena in your
life. Nevertheless, you should also read books for education, and you should
structure your library. The "Projects" section in LeaderTask organizer is
convenient for this purpose. Here you should also create an "Information"
project, which will contain all the information required for each role. Thanks
to the ability to assign projects and several labels, you will be able to find
the necessary information for any of the roles in a few clicks.

## 13\. Key Notes

To record useful information about tasks, Stephen Covey recommends a detailed
and fairly sophisticated note-taking system that allows you to find the
information you need relatively quickly in a paper organizer.

With the development of computer technology, the need for manual page turning is
becoming more and more rare, and search functions and capabilities are becoming
wider and more diverse.

**Stephen Covey is an excellent expert in the field of time organization. His
methodology has allowed many people to improve and even radically change their
lives. Using the system of this guru of internal resource management and
implementing it with LeaderTask organizer, you too can qualitatively increase
the level of your self-organization and achieve high efficiency and harmony in
your life.**
