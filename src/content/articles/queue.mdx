Big to-do lists are the real enemy of productivity. From dozens of tasks, it can
be difficult to choose the most important ones and decide where to start again.

Queue offers to remove the long list. The plugin will prioritize the tasks and
suggest one that you will work on at the moment. You can take it to work or
postpone it, then the system will show the next task. The "Queue" plugin will
help you clear the clutter at work, keep your productivity and focus on a single
task.

##### Price: 22 $.

Once purchased, the Queue plugin will be available to all license users, both
current and future.

**Note**: The plug-in works only in the Web-version of LeaderTask. Web-plugin is
purchased separately from the license once and for all.
