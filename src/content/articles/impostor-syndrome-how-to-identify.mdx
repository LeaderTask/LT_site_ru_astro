You have received a salary increase, a promotion, an invitation to an
interesting project, but instead of rejoicing at your success, you feel doubts
and fear: what if it was a mistake, and you accidentally took someone else's
place? It seems to you that the management simply did not notice your
incompetence, and soon the truth will "come out". Just thinking about it
literally makes you sweat.

If you're familiar with these thoughts, chances are you've encountered "imposter
syndrome." What is this term? Why does it occur? What steps to take to
successfully overcome it, and what personal benefits can be derived from this
condition. Let's discuss these and other questions below.

## The imposter syndrome in psychology

According to research conducted by a Florida-based research institute,
Behavioural Science Research Institute, more than 70 per cent of those in the
creative professions have dealt with imposter syndrome at least once in their
lives. According to Indeed's 2022 report, three out of five employees surveyed
experience the phenomenon on a regular basis.

Imposter syndrome is a psychological condition accompanied by insecurity,
inability to evaluate one's achievements soberly. A person is haunted by
thoughts that he does not deserve success. Just happened to be at the right
place at the right time, and in fact, is worthless as a professional and
specialist. Because of this, he is constantly haunted by the fear of exposure:
"soon everyone will realise that I am actually a complete zero in this matter,
and then a real scandal will break out, I will lose my position, money, a
prestigious job".

Imposter syndrome was first described by psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and
Susan Eames in 1978. They used the stories of successful women who had many
achievements in academia, but who felt uncomfortable and insecure in the
workplace, as if their results had been achieved by chance. As a result of
further research, it was found that men were no less likely to develop this
condition.

If we characterise imposter syndrome in simple words - it is not a mental
disorder, it is not a disease that requires treatment. It is a set of complexes
and experiences that people experience from time to time. It was noted that most
often creative professionals, highly educated people in the age group of 25-39
years old (up to 27%) consider themselves "imposters" in the workplace.

## What is imposter syndrome

The cycle of the syndrome is triggered at times when some goals need to be
achieved. In this case, any tasks that require effort are evaluated as
"achievements". For example, defending a term paper, implementing a project,
taking on new responsibilities. A person feels excitement and fear that he will
not cope with the new case, will let down colleagues, management, loved ones.
Staying in a state of anxiety prevents the person from starting to fulfil the
assigned task. As a result, two behavioural scenarios may develop:
procrastination or excessive activity in preparation for the task:

- In the first case, important things are constantly postponed. When the
  deadline inevitably approaches, the person has to work hard to meet the
  deadline. Nervous and physical tension is accompanied by a debilitating sense
  of guilt arising from the inability to systematise and allocate tasks
  properly.

- The opposite situation, where the performer becomes fixated on preparing for a
  task, leads to insomnia, irritability, eating disorders and other symptoms
  associated with chronic stress.

Finally, having successfully handed in the work, a person feels real relief,
even euphoria, which is quickly replaced by a feeling of worthlessness and
failure. If the desired result was achieved at the last moment, then it is just
luck. And if intensive work brought the desired results, then it's all in it. In
fact, as a specialist, he is worthless. The worries are even more aggravated by
the examples of more hurried colleagues that manage to manage everything in
time, sleep well and still look great. That is, "fertile ground" for the
development of imposter syndrome is the fear of social comparison. After all, it
is not difficult to find a worthy object with which to compare your professional
achievements both within the framework of a common project and the company.

## Causes of imposter syndrome

![](/image-54.webp)

One of the main reasons is that imposter syndrome is directly related to the
orientation to the opinion of others: the desire for recognition, praise,
positive evaluation for achievements. Prerequisites for the development of
imposter syndrome arise in childhood, when a person is highly dependent on
parents, teachers, and his environment. The most common preconditions for the
syndrome include:

- Constant comparison with more successful people - brothers, sisters - on the
  part of parents, leading to lower self-esteem, forming the habit of comparing
  their successes with the opinions and expectations of others. Which means that
  now the child will feel insufficiently clever, intelligent. Similar results
  are given by increased demanding ness to a person. He indoctrinates himself
  that he will be able to earn love and attention only when he is "on top".

- Excessive praise, glossing over mistakes. Parents paint an ideal picture of
  the future for their favourite child, showing what amazing prospects await him
  with his unique abilities. However, in real life, high expectations encounter
  various difficulties (refusal to get a job, low marks in exams).

- Imposition of other people's attitudes and goals. Presenting their son or
  daughter as successful in some sphere, parents try to transfer their
  unrealised goals to their children, expecting them to live according to their
  attitudes: to get a job abroad, to graduate from a prestigious university, to
  have a big family. Because of this, children automatically follow the chosen
  algorithm, do not find themselves, and when they grow up and acquire the
  syndrome, they feel themselves occupying someone else's place by mistake.

- Inappropriate evaluation of achievements. Success, accompanied by envy, anger,
  ridicule from rivals, often turns into a refusal to recognise one's own
  achievements. A person justifies them by a random coincidence of events, does
  not feel worthy of victory.

## How to identify imposter syndrome in yourself: main signs

The imposter syndrome manifests itself differently in each person. But, its main
sign is the presence of a sense of fear, anxiety, sometimes shame that sooner or
later it will turn out that he is not who he really is. The development of this
condition is also indicated by the following symptoms:

- Doubts about one's own professional suitability;

- An abiding belief: "One owes his success to chance, not to personal ability
  and talent."

- Inability to recognise their positive attributes and achievements;

- Chronic fear of mistakes and failure;

- An unrelenting sense of guilt;

- Low self-esteem;

- Excessive demanding, strictness to oneself;

- Focusing on failure;

- Striving to be the best, special, need for positive feedback for emotional
  well-being.

To see if you have symptoms of the syndrome, you can use a psychological test
developed by the author of a book about the phenomenon, Pauline Rose Clance.
Here are some questions from this test to which you should give a positive or
negative answer:

1. Are your qualifications inadequate for your position?

2. Are you afraid of other people's judgement?

3. Receiving praise for achievements, do you think it's just an act of courtesy
   to you?

4. Do you attribute your successes to a happy accident?

5. Are you afraid of not living up to other people's expectations?

6. Are you not able to complete the assigned tasks perfectly as you would like?

7. You keep almost finishing, in fact, can you actually do more and better?

8. Are you afraid of failing at new assignments, even if you have completed past
   assignments successfully?

9. Do you compare yourself to other people (not in your favour)?

10. Are you superstitious, afraid to talk about a promotion or a new project "so
    as not to jinx it"?

Having a majority of positive responses indicates that you most likely live in
this state.

## Types of imposters

![](/image-55.webp)

According to Valerie Young's classification, people suffering from imposter
syndrome can be roughly divided into five groups:

- Perfectionist achievers strive to always be ahead of the curve. They are
  always chasing the ideal, their attention is fully focused on the final
  results of tasks. One tiny flaw out of 100 is considered a disaster and a
  failure.

- Expert or perfectionist intellectuals. They fixate on processes, paying
  maximum attention to whether they can do the job well. Such people constantly
  attend various training courses, trainings, but they keep putting things off
  for later, because they are afraid of lack of knowledge in the required area.

- Natural geniuses. Everything is easy for them from birth, so any effort to
  master new skills is perceived as a failure. Because of this, when faced with
  difficulties in adulthood, they lose confidence in themselves.

- Soloists or individualists. They are used to doing everything on their own.
  They do not know how to delegate and are afraid to entrust others with their
  tasks. Only they can do the job well.

- Superhumans, supermen. Ready to combine many roles, to work without breaks and
  weekends. At the same time, they have to manage everywhere and do their work
  perfectly. Failure in any area leads to discomfort and suffering.

Often these behaviours are combined with each other. However, there is a common
quality in each of these types - a sense of loneliness and isolation. A person
with imposter syndrome feels that he is the only "wrong" person among normal
people. The fear of being rejected leads to silence and isolation.

### The consequences of imposter syndrome

Ignoring this condition leads to a loss of psychological comfort both in life
and at work, which, with prolonged progression, may provoke the development of
neuroses with an anxious-depressive component. Because of the feeling of guilt,
shame for his actions, a person isolates himself from the outside world, which
as a result worsens his social adaptation. There are absenteeism at work or
study, leading to dismissal, to expulsion from the university. His career growth
and development is stopped. Failure to take adequate measures to combat this
phenomenon is fraught with the following problems:

- Low salary, working in low positions in the company due to misjudging one's
  skills and abilities;

- By turning down interesting projects and tasks;

- Procrastination;

- An inability to ask others for help;

- Workaholism developing against a background of perfectionism.

## How to beat imposter syndrome

The best way to overcome this phenomenon is to visit a professional
psychologist. Together with him you will understand what lies at the root of the
syndrome, the hidden causes of your experiences, and develop a strategy for
self-actualisation, in which your insecurity and anxiety will work in your
favour.

There are also specific recommendations for working through the syndrome on your
own.

1. Celebrate your successes and achievements. To make it clear, you can make a
   list of tasks that you have coped with over the past year. When you analyse
   it, you will realise that not all your achievements are due to coincidence or
   luck.

2. Ask colleagues, friends, and management for feedback. There are probably
   experts in your environment whom you consider to be authorities in your
   field. Listen to their assessment, even if the praise seems exaggerated.

3. Use the driver's technique. Remember: your doubts and fears are only in your
   head. You can control your life, which means you can cope with all your
   worries.

4. Learn to work with your emotions. It is normal for everyone to feel anxiety,
   fear or shame from time to time. It's normal. So, instead of running away
   from your worries, try to make sense of them. Accept them, analyse them in
   detail. For example, write down your fears on a piece of paper, and next to
   them indicate the positive aspects that will override them.

## Conclusion

Imposter syndrome is an illusory, invented condition based solely on your
opinion and not on concrete facts. This is an internal process that you can cope
with, turning it from the worst enemy into a companion and helper. Every person
has a tendency to periodically doubt himself, his competences and capabilities.
The main thing is to understand that everything in life is finite, that periods
of doubt and failures will be followed by periods of success and achievements.
If you act correctly, any crises can be turned into stepping stones for future
achievements. The main thing is not to dwell on inner worries, to cultivate
calmness, self-confidence, to celebrate successes, and not to strive to please
others in everything.
