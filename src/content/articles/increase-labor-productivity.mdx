To determine the productivity of companies and their employees, labor
productivity indicators are used. On the basis of their analysis, various
management decisions are made concerning the increase or reduction of staff, the
need to modernize production or personal changes. The higher the indicators, the
better the business is performing.

## In what is the increase in labor productivity

The criterion determines how useful an employee is to the company and how
efficiently he works. Based on this indicator, standards are developed and
methods of motivation and labor remuneration (in the form of salary or hourly
wage) are approved. Increased productivity contributes to increased profits of
companies, effective development of the economy as a whole.

The growth of labor productivity is followed by the growth of the population's
welfare. Due to the timely transfer of taxes and increase in wages, the social
sphere is developing, pensions and social payments are increasing, and free
medical services are becoming more accessible.

### Productivity indicators, methods of their calculation and analysis

By comparing the data on productivity in dynamics, it is possible to assess how
loaded the company's employees are, whether it is necessary to reduce or, on the
contrary, to expand the staff. The analysis will give an idea of what
innovations will affect the efficiency of the enterprise. For example, an
increase in salary or the introduction of a system of personal incentives for
employees.

The study of the obtained data will help to find places in management that need
to be reorganized or "tightened". To accurately determine the criterion, a
special formula is used:

**PT = Volume of goods produced ÷ Number of employees of the company
(department).**

Simply put, this parameter consists of two elements: output and labor intensity.
Output is the volume of products or services performed by an employee. It is
calculated as follows:

**B = Volume of products, services (in money, standard hours or in kind).**

Labor intensity shows how much labor is required to create one product. It is
determined by the formula inverse of productivity: Labor intensity = Unit of
time ÷ Quantity of goods produced.

**Several methods are used to evaluate effectiveness:**

- **Natural**. Accounts for the number of items produced piece by piece by an
  employee (shop, enterprise). It is used at industrial enterprises producing
  homogeneous products.

- **Cost (monetary)**. It is used in industries characterized by frequent price
  changes, engaged in the production of heterogeneous products. For example, in
  a factory producing 10 blouses and 4 pantsuits per day, labor efficiency will
  be higher in the department producing suits, because their market value is
  higher.

- **Labor**. Determines how much time an employee spent on the task at hand.
  This method is used to determine productivity in the service industry.

**In analytics, three types of performance are distinguished:**

- **Nominal**. It denotes how many goods or services can be produced using 100%
  of the company's resources. This parameter is used in project planning.

- **Actual**. If a seamstress makes 16 shirts in a shift of 8 hours, actual
  output is 2 pieces per hour.

- **Potential**. Demonstrates how much it is possible to increase the output of
  products or services with the help of new management technologies, modern
  planning and work organization tools.

## Ways to increase labor productivity

Many factors influence the level of labor productivity. Possible ways to
increase it:

- Increasing the quantity of products or services without compromising quality;

- improving the quality of manufactured products (rendered services) while
  maintaining the production volume;

- reduction of labor costs per unit of goods;

- reduction of the total share of labor costs in the cost of production.

Achievement of the above results is possible with the implementation of a set of
measures, including:

- Ensures full utilization of production capacities. Prevents intensive
  operation or overloading of one type of equipment while another is idle.

- Improving the logistics of the enterprise.

- Automation of production processes. Replacing live labor with hardware
  significantly speeds up the production process, making it possible to
  eliminate errors due to the human factor.

- Improvement of management and organizational structure. It allows to introduce
  modern methods of project management, increase the responsibility of mid-level
  personnel, and reduce the burden on managers by delegating personal authority
  to employees.

- Personnel motivation. It represents encouragement in the form of bonuses,
  other monetary rewards, allowances for professionalism, special working
  conditions. Or it is manifested in non-material form (increased vacation, the
  opportunity to work on a flexible schedule or remotely).

- Creates comfortable conditions at workplaces. Improves the emotional state of
  the team, helping them to cope with tasks faster.

- Professional development of employees in courses or trainings.

- Observance of labor discipline in the team. Employees should understand their
  responsibility to the company and spend their working day for the benefit of
  the common cause and the team, without being distracted by extraneous matters.
  This will allow to quickly cope with any projects, achieving the set goals
  with less labor and time.

Labor productivity in services, sales, IT is influenced by the decisions and
actions of managers. Therefore, in this case it is important for the manager to
set goals correctly. They should be realistic and achievable, so that the staff
can take them responsibly and seriously.

Employees should concentrate on their personal tasks and not be dispersed into a
multitude of small tasks that are not part of their direct duties. They should
not be responsible for cleaning the office (store, hairdresser's) or sending
correspondence to the post office. It would be better if this was handled by a
separate employee, while the main specialists would spend their working time for
the greater benefit of the company.

Delegation of authority, which allows to relieve the manager from routine tasks
to solve important strategic issues, can increase performance. By distributing
current tasks among subordinates, it is possible to prevent burnout of
management personnel due to overload, increasing responsibility and leadership
qualities of the company's employees.

Personnel training should be an important part of the company's corporate
culture. Continuous personnel development activities are a prerequisite for the
company's survival in market conditions.

## Factors of labor productivity increase

Negative factors that reduce productivity include:

- increased depreciation of the company's fixed assets;

- use of outdated technology;

- incompetent management of the enterprise;

- unfavorable microclimate in the work team;

- low wages.

Competent project management will help to avoid these problems. The manager
assembles a team of qualified specialists. He organizes suitable conditions for
each team member, motivates employees, and maintains a favorable emotional
climate within the team.

Possible factors for increasing labor productivity include:

- **Material and technical**. They imply improvement of the company's production
  base by introducing modern equipment, automation of production processes, use
  of resource-saving technologies.

- **Organizational and economic**. They include improvement of personnel,
  material equipment, organization of work and rest of employees, their
  motivation and application of progressive methods of payment and motivation.

- **Social and psychological**. They include measures to improve the working
  conditions of employees, create a favorable environment within working teams,
  and improve the quality of life.

Emotional state of employees and job satisfaction have a positive impact on
efficiency. Interested people work with greater efficiency. This leads to
increased profits and company development. Employees who are disengaged from the
work process demotivate others, reducing the overall productivity of the
company.

In teams with a large number of dissatisfied employees, conflicts often arise
due to personal grudges, misunderstandings, overloading the work of some
specialists at the expense of freeing up others. People lose interest in their
work and perform it poorly. The task of each manager is to form a positive
attitude to work in his subordinates, using individual approaches and modern
project management tools.

## Mistakes

One of the first mistakes of many companies is the unjustified expansion of the
administrative and management apparatus. People who have been given high
positions claim higher salaries. However, they are not always able to take
responsibility or competently supervise their subordinates. To demonstrate their
weight in the team, such leaders organize endless meetings. They demand reports
from their subordinates on any issues, preventing them from focusing on their
direct duties.

You can avoid the presence of "superfluous" people in the company's management
by using a simple formula for building a management structure. One manager is
sufficient for a group of 7-10 people. For larger organizations, for example, of
50 people, a two-stage management system is suitable, including 5 managers
managing departments of 10 people and a general director.

Another mistake that leads to a decrease in labor productivity: unnecessary
service personnel who are idle most of the time. To solve this problem, we need
to analyze the workload of the management staff and support services and
optimize the number of employees.

Illiterate decisions of managers and improper organization of personnel work
negatively affect efficiency.

## Programs to help increase productivity

For efficient work within a company, it is important to use modern technical
tools to help plan and organize work processes. These are special programs,
services, electronic assistants and digital applications for individual and

## Conclusion

Productivity can be improved in a number of ways. For example, by rationally
distributing the working time of the organization's employees. Or by introducing
modern equipment into production.

Creating a comfortable environment for the company's employees can help increase
productivity. People who are independently responsible for the tasks assigned to
them take their work more seriously. A manager should not control every step of
a subordinate, trusting him to freely dispose of his time and resources.
Competent leadership consists in checking the work done and analyzing its
result. Teamwork, involving managers and executives in joint project management
will help to achieve better results.

Efficient work is impossible without well-built communications within the
company. For this purpose, it is necessary to use modern tools that help to
control the extent and quality of tasks performed to obtain optimal results.
