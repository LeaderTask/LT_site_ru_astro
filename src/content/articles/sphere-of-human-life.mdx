Psychology studies the concept of "spheres of life". These are different areas
of activity, manifestations of reality, relationships that form a person's
unique personality. On how harmoniously they interact with each other, depends
on his success, well-being, moral state, the feeling of satisfaction from life.
To achieve harmony between these constituent parts it is important to maintain
balance. They should not interfere or contradict each other in any way.

If we consider human life as a living organism, in it the spheres of life
represent separate parts of the body united in a single system, each of which
performs its separate functions. Legs are needed for walking, hands for
manipulating objects, head for thinking, and so on. For a moment, imagine what
would happen if all these organs were replaced by a single, universal one? The
human organism would degenerate, return to the amoeba stage. And so it is in
life: the more complex its structure, the more complete and diverse it is.

## Main spheres of life

There is no universal model of human life. Everyone chooses how to behave in
different situations, what aspect of life to focus on in order to succeed. Some
people go into sports or music. Other people go into business or politics. And
someone prioritizes health and upbringing of children. There are quite a lot of
options. Many different studies have been conducted on this topic. One of the
popular models was proposed by an American management consultant, Stephen Covey,
who described it in his book "Seven Skills of Highly Effective People".
According to Covey's theory, a person interacts with four spheres in the process
of life activity:

| Spheres of life                                                                        |     |                                             |                         |                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Physical                                                                               |     | Mental/intellectual                         | Духовной                | Social/emotional                                                 |
| Everything that has to do with the body, the human organism. Base for other processes. |     | Mindfulness, critical thinking development. | The inner world of man. | Relationships with others, socializing, building communications. |

Each of the above aspects affects the success, harmoniousness of the
personality. The physical sphere is the base. For its development it is
important to lead a healthy lifestyle:

1. Eat right, maintain a drinking regime by drinking 30 grams of clean water per
   kilogram of weight (about 7-8 glasses) every day. To implement this useful
   habit, you can set a reminder on your phone or in your task manager.

2. Get rid of bad habits: cigarettes, hookah, alcohol.

3. Practice regular physical activity. Start with a daily 20-minute exercise
   routine, choosing a suitable activity that you enjoy. This could be jogging,
   an intense workout at the gym, or home yoga in a comfortable environment.

4. Undertake timely medical examinations.

The development of the mental sphere depends on the reliability and efficient
operation of the "base", i.e. the physical side. Various "upgrades" can be built
on it with the help of the following practices:

1. Readings. Books provide food for thought, increase erudition and develop
   intelligence.

2. Learning foreign languages. You can practice on language courses or while
   traveling. This way you will not only expand your vocabulary, but also learn
   to express yourself in another language.

3. Set life goals for a month, a year, 3 years. You can formulate them in your
   head or fix them in writing. Knowing the goal will help to prioritize
   correctly, concentrating on really important tasks, getting rid of vanity.

4. Developing mindfulness. From time to time ask yourself the question: "What am
   I doing?", "Why?".

The concept of spirituality refers to an ideal. To get closer to it, a person
needs to:

1. Determine for yourself the highest spiritual values. They differ from person
   to person, and this is normal: some people put forward movement and
   development above all else, while stability is more important to others. One
   is obsessed with scientific discoveries, while another cannot imagine life
   without creativity.

2. Focus on inner sensations, meditate.

3. Doing charity or social work, helping other people.

To develop in the social sphere, use Stephen Covey's rule: "First try to
understand, then be understood". Don't look for blame. Analyze and deal with
emotions that arise in tense situations. Ask yourself: "Why am I reacting this
way?". This will allow you to better understand yourself and find harmony with
the world around you.

The German scientist of Iranian origin, Nossrat Pezeshkian, the founder of
positive psychology, developed the Balance Model of Happiness based on the 4
qualities of life. In the course of his global research, he traveled to 5
continents of the world and studied more than 20 national cultures. In addition
to material status, religion and social status, the scientist asked people what
makes them happy? What place does money occupy in their lives? How much time do
they devote to work? After analyzing the information received, Pazeshkian
concluded that there are four paths to happiness:

1. Feelings (body). This is the appearance, health, lifestyle of a person.

2. Intuition (meaning). This category includes the inner world, the spiritual
   side of an individual's life. It also includes the system of values, goals,
   faith, the overall meaning of existence.

3. Traditions (contacts). Or relationships with other people, kinship,
   friendship, love ties.

4. Mind (activity). This part of life is devoted to professional realization. It
   includes achievements in studies, at work, hobbies. Success in this sphere is
   characterized by material prosperity of a person.

The spheres of a person's life strongly influence personal identification. They
are inextricably linked, inseparable from each other. For a full-fledged
existence, it is necessary to develop each of these sides. Ignoring any of them
will inevitably lead to problems, conflicts and chaos in life.

## Relationship with public spheres

Human life takes place within society. It is a complex multilevel system in
which various processes take place. It is divided into intermediate complexes
consisting of separate elements - subsystems, forming groups of social
relations. Four subsystems are distinguished in social life:

| Economic                                                                                 | Political                                                                     | Social                                                                                                                      | Spiritual                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It is the economic activity of an individual, a family, a country.                       | It is connected with the arrangement of the state, judicial system, security. | Consists of two parts: 1\. Society as a whole; 2.Organizations and institutions that support the welfare of the population. | Reflects the moral and spiritual makeup of society.                                               |
| Its elements: Economy; Forms of ownership; Taxes; Entrepreneurship; Banks; Unemployment. | Includes: State; Political parties; Legislation                               | Includes people, social groups, nations, estates and classes.                                                               | It includes: Church; Scientific, educational institutions; Laboratories; Theaters, art galleries. |
| Gives funds for the development of other areas.                                          | Ensures the peaceful existence of people.                                     | Helps meet primary needs.                                                                                                   | Produces and communicates new knowledge and values.                                               |

The influence of the spheres of social life on the personality is related to the
needs of the individual:

- Material;

- In socializing with other people;

- In discipline, organization, law, order, peace;

- In self-affirmation, realization of abilities, truth, beauty, moral and
  spiritual growth.

## Condition diagnosis

Knowing the characteristics of life spheres, you can independently assess their
condition. To do this, you need to honestly answer a few questions:

- What successes have you had in this area?

- Does it bring you pleasure?

- How much time do you devote to this part of your life?

- Do you receive praise from others for your accomplishments in this area of
  endeavor?

By answering all the above questions frankly and honestly, you will realize what
is wrong with you. Get a kind of impetus to improve your life. With the areas
that received positive answers, you are fine. Areas with negative answers
require improvement and fine-tuning.

### Balance wheel

To improve the quality of life, psychologists recommend using the "Wheel of Life
Balance" method. To create it, a circle is drawn, consisting of separate
segments-spheres. It is filled taking into account the degree of development of
one or another direction. The number of segments can be different, depending on
the number of spheres of life. Some people will need 8 sectors, and some will
need 12.

A circle does not have to have a perfectly round shape. It is physically
impossible to excel in all areas. Its main function is to help a person move
forward by demonstrating which areas require more careful work. The technique
helps to structure, balance life, avoid critical situations and crises.

## How to evolve in the living environment

![How to evolve in the living environment](/razvitie-v-zhiznennoi-srede-1024x682-1.webp)

Each sphere is part of a person's personality. Ideally, they should all be well
developed and "pumped up". Then you will be active, energetic, purposeful,
self-confident and invulnerable to addictions. But in practice, most of the
spheres of life are in a state of frustration. That is, to engage in them, there
is no time or energy. But there is one favorite area of life, to which it is not
a pity to devote all your time. It can be a job that a person is ready to devote
24 hours a day. Or the desire to look good, to stay always young.

Such fixation becomes a fertile ground for the nurturing of all sorts of
addictions. A person who is passionate about work can quickly turn into a
fanatical workaholic. And a follower of a healthy lifestyle will not notice how
he becomes a chronic hypochondriac, constantly experiencing fear and anxiety
about his life. That is, all the positive aspects that a person received from
his favorite sphere will be completely destroyed. For example, after the birth
of a child, a woman devotes all her time to her family, sacrificing personal
interests and career. She is not realized as a professional, ruins her talents,
is completely dependent on her husband. Over time, this leads to mutual claims,
quarrels, conflicts and breakdown of relationships.

Systematic and constant development in all areas will help to avoid this. This
can be 3-4 main areas and any number of minor ones. Even if at first some of
them may seem uninteresting or boring, you will gradually get involved in the
process, and the positive results will not be long in coming.

achieve. To do this, you need to clearly formulate your goals. All people are
unique, so each person lives and develops in certain spheres. Someone puts
material values in the first place, while others are more important morality or
spirituality. To achieve harmony in life, it is important not to dwell on any
