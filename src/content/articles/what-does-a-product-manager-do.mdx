In 2023, the profession of product manager is rapidly gaining popularity. Many
serious companies, especially in the IT sector, need qualified specialists
responsible for creating a product and promoting it on the market. But, since
this specialty has appeared relatively recently, there are periodically
misunderstandings about what duties a product manager performs. In addition,
this position is often confused with project manager or product owner.

Let's try to understand what skills and competencies you need to have in order
to master this profession, because product managers are not trained at
universities. What areas of business, apart from IT, you can work in, and how to
become a real pro at it.

## Who is a product manager and what does he do in a company?

![](/product-manager.webp)

Product manager is a strategist who manages all the processes involved in the
creation of a product. He is involved in its planning, development and launch.
He continues to work on the product after it is released on the market,
developing it, providing technical support. This is not only a manager, but also
a creative, programmer, marketer, analyst, designer. He generates ideas, ensures
their implementation, makes reports on the product to analyze and improve
business processes. The nature of his tasks and responsibilities directly
depends on the specifics of the company's business.

If you are applying for the position of a product manager, be sure to pay
attention to the list of requirements for the position in each specific case.
For example, in one firm, this person is responsible for generating ideas on his
own, while in another, he only monitors the implementation of the chosen
strategy.

The career of a product manager starts at the bottom rung of Associate Product
Manager, which is most often occupied by developers, project managers,
marketers, and system analysts working in an organization. People "from the
outside" and newcomers without relevant experience are reluctant to take the
position. Therefore, a number of large companies organize specialized courses to
train product management specialists from scratch.

In the process, junior product managers solve the problems assigned to them. For
example, a manager notes a low conversion rate for paying for an order in a food
delivery app (compared to similar products on the market). The reason behind the
problem: inconvenience in entering card data. It can be solved by implementing
payment via Apple Pay or Google Pay. The task of the product manager is to
develop a convenient interface together with the designer, control the
development process and implement the new solution in the software product. In
principle, a project manager performs similar tasks, but his competence is
limited to releasing updates to production. An Associate Product Manager solves
the problem set before him. Therefore, after the release, he monitors analytics
and makes sure that the task has been solved correctly, conversion has
increased, and users have no difficulties in using the application.

As the Associate Product Manager accumulates experience in the course of solving
various business career tasks, he "grows" to a real product manager. He is well
versed in his chosen field and the characteristics of the product. He is aware
of all the work processes taking place in the team, knows in what direction the
team is moving and what goal it is trying to achieve. Independently makes
decisions concerning the product. A project manager always acts according to an
approved plan. For example: a company plans to erect a building. He is obliged
to build a house with the characteristics specified in the plan by the specified
deadline.

Significant differences between a product manager and a project manager:

|                    | **Product**                                                                                                                                        | **Project**                                                                 |

| Performance result | Launching the finished product into production with further refinement after release.                                                              | Creating new work methods and processes.                                    |

Product and project managers work together to accomplish tasks in teams to get
the best results. Only the former are different in that they focus on the
product itself, while the latter deal with resource management, scheduling, and
budget allocation.

## Skills and responsibilities of a product manager

It is the responsibility of the Product Manager to be actively involved in every
product development cycle:

1. Idea Presentation. It should create and properly tell, convey the concept of
   a new product.

2. Determines the needs and preferences of future users of the product. For this
   purpose, various studies are conducted to identify the positions of target
   audience segments in different age categories, with differences in
   socio-demographic status. With the help of the information obtained, a
   portrait of the future user is drawn up.

3. Integration of ideas and product vision of all line managers of the company.
   For this purpose, discussions are held within the team. They clarify how much
   time the executives need to design a digital product, and what exactly will
   be of interest to users in the new application. After analyzing fresh ideas
   and hypotheses, the tasks for the next sprint are adjusted.

4. Elaboration of the path, overall vision and main directions for the
   development of the product or service. Preparation of a specification with
   requirements for it. It specifies what kind of product it will be, what goals
   it pursues, how the success of its launch will be measured.

5. Creating a project roadmap that prioritizes product management in line with
   the company's business objectives. For example, some projects prioritize the
   speed of hypothesis testing.

6. Control over the work of developers and designers. A product manager monitors
   their activities, identifies emerging difficulties in a timely manner, and
   takes measures to improve work processes. For example, if the team fails to
   deliver work on time, hire another developer. Most product teams are based on
   Agile technologies. Their work is divided into sprints, at the end of each of
   which the product should receive a new artifact, some small innovation that
   has real value. For example, a new button, a feature, a user interface
   improvement.

7. MVP testing - minimum viable product (the name comes from the principle of
   Minimal Viable Product). Product Manager evaluates its effectiveness, looks
   for upgrade opportunities, analyzes sales and marketing averages, and
   interviews customers. It collects user stories together with developers: what
   difficulties they had while using the product, what buttons they pressed,
   what tabs they clicked, what features they didn't use. Based on the data
   received, tickets are created - the tasks the team will work on.

A product manager works closely with developers, designers, copywriters,
management and investors of the company. It is important for him to have certain
knowledge, qualifications and skills to perform his duties successfully. Get an
idea of what a product manager does from the hard skills and soft skills of the
profession.

Professional Competencies:

- Ability to work with a variety of information gathering techniques.

- Basic knowledge of development and technology.

- Analytical experience in studying competitor strategy.

- Understanding user needs and preferences.

- Ability to competently set goals and product development plans.

- Actively work to maintain and further promote the product line in media and
  other channels.

The soft skills of a product manager include:

- Developed communication skills. Creation of any product implies active
  interaction with the team and other stakeholders. Therefore, the product
  manager must correctly convey to each performer the essence of his task, be
  able to defend and justify his point of view. But, at the same time, he must
  hear others.

- Ability to resolve conflicts, support a friendly atmosphere in the team.

- Critical thinking. Having this skill helps to make the right decisions based
  on analyzing the information received, establishing the relationship between
  the facts.

- Ability to adapt quickly to any conditions and situations, to sense moments
  when a project requires urgent adjustments.

In addition, a product manager should develop such qualities and character
traits as curiosity for everything new, desire to learn, develop outlook,
responsibility and creativity. He should be disciplined and organized in work
and life. For this purpose, it is necessary to master the best techniques and
methods of time management.

## How a product manager's performance is evaluated

The work of a sales manager is evaluated by internal and external criteria.
Internal factors include the interaction within the team: how its members
communicate with each other, how satisfied they are with their work, and how
communication between performers is structured. If there are favorable
partnerships in the team, everyone is committed to the common achievement of
goals, and they perform their duties at a high level, it means that the product
is doing its job well. Various metrics are used for external evaluation (profit,
financial results, customer satisfaction and other parameters). For example, in
the IT industry, a big indicator of a product manager's effectiveness is user
retention.
