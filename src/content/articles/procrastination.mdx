If for some reason you are always putting things off "for later", doing anything
but important tasks, "congratulations", most likely it means that you have
procrastination. With this phenomenon sooner or later face all people on the
planet. But when this way of life becomes a pattern, it negatively affects your
work and career, and in your personal life. Then there is a need to get rid of
the ailment.

## What is procrastination in simple words

![Procrastinate again](/procrastinate-again-1024x684.webp)

The term "procrastination" comes from Latin. It consists of two words: where
"pro" means - "instead of" and "crastinus" - "tomorrow", the definition in
English will also not be different - "procrastination". So procrastination is,
in simple words, a persistent desire to put off important matters until
tomorrow.

Sometimes procrastination is identified with laziness. But this is an erroneous
opinion, because these two concepts differ in their essence. In fact, it is
worth noting that the process is much more complex and profound than it may seem
at first glance. A lazy person simply rests most of the time, and to
procrastinate, it means to spend vital forces and energy on empty, unnecessary
things. He understands the illogicality, incorrectness of his actions, which
helps him to realize their negative consequences, experiencing a constant
feeling of guilt.

A person turns on his computer to start work, the deadline for which is
approaching by the hour, but remembers that yesterday he was going to call his
sister. After a thirty-minute conversation, another pause follows: it's time for
a morning cup of coffee. Then someone calls again, and it's "just around the
corner" lunch time. As a result, he starts his main tasks at the very last
moment, feverishly trying to meet the deadlines. He is nervous, berating
himself, assuring himself that this is "the last time".

On the one hand, self-avoidance of unpleasant situations or overly difficult
tasks is a normal reaction of the psyche. In psychology, it is described as a
defense mechanism that gets rid of the anxiety that arises when solving
problems. But, when procrastination turns into a chronic form, its consequences
will be quite unfortunate. In the long run, procrastinators face such problems
as: severe forms of depression, job loss, lack of vitality.

Unlike laziness, which is caused by passive character, inertia and
indecisiveness, procrastination arises from the refusal to take responsibility.
If Alex is lying on the couch thinking: "I don't feel like doing anything today.
I'd better watch new YouTube videos" - this is a typical example of laziness. If
his mind is spinning with thoughts like: "Man, I have so much to do today, and
I'm lying on the couch" - this is already procrastination. A person does not
refuse to fulfill obligations, but takes up work at the last moment. This is
often due to the inability to properly assess its volume. The nature of such a
phenomenon is not finally studied properly, so there is no consensus on the
selection of means and methods to combat procrastination. The number of people
in the world who face procrastination is constantly growing. In a few words,
procrastination can be characterized as follows:

- A person's emotional reaction to unfinished business, manifested in a relaxed
  or tense manner.

- Physiologically, the process arises from a conflict between two areas of the
  brain: the prefrontal cortex (the planning center) and the limbic system,
  which is responsible for pleasure.

Procrastination is not a disease, not a sign of weakness. Every person,
regardless of temperament, mental abilities, is characterized by periodic
postponement of things for later. It is necessary to deal with procrastination
only when it affects vital processes.

## Types of Procrastination

![Types of procrastination](/procrastinate-1024x683.webp)

Procrastination as a psychological phenomenon has two forms of expression:

- Passive. These are moments when a task is postponed because of decision-making
  problems.

- Active. This is when procrastination becomes a kind of motivation, a challenge
  for active action.

American psychologist Stanley Milgram has identified the following types of
procrastination:

1. Domestic, related to putting off regular household chores, such as doing the
   dishes or taking out the trash.

2. Neurotic, affecting vital decisions.

3. Academic, relating to all learning-related tasks.

4. Making decisions when, despite having all the necessary information and
   facts, they are put off "for tomorrow".

5. Compulsive, evolving into a sustained behavioral pattern.

Procrastinators are divided into categories based on different behavioral
patterns:

- Perfectionists put off important tasks for fear of not meeting expectations.
  They fear that they will not do it perfectly.

- Dreamers live in their own world, where everything is easy and simple, and are
  not ready to put their ideas into practice, the real stop makes them tense.

- The restless are so afraid of change and loss of familiar comfort that they
  take no action to change anything about the way things are.

- Crisis makers need an incentive to get to work. The threat of a deadline
  becomes the magic kick in the pants that forces them to pull themselves
  together.

- The obsequious are willing to do anything to earn praise. They focus not on
  the quality of their work, but on the impression they make. As a result, they
  often never get to the real work, but make a lot of excuses to delay the
  fulfillment of their tasks.

- Unruly are real rebels, not ready to "dance to someone else's tune". Promising
  to fulfill some task, they deliberately postpone the beginning of the process,
  thus demonstrating superiority and power over others. Yes, they will do it,
  but later.

For all its negative consequences, procrastination can be beneficial.
Interestingly, according to American entrepreneur Paul Graham, there is a
positive form of procrastination that does not require treatment or any
adjustments. He categorized such procrastination into three types:

- Absence of any action.

- Replacing major tasks with other equally important things to do.

- Getting more important, high priority things done.

Stanford University professor John Perry suggests that procrastination should be
viewed as an organized phenomenon, structuring tasks so that the most important
ones are at the top of the list and the unimportant ones at the bottom. This
structure can be changed and unfolded as you like.

## Causes of Procrastination

![Causes of Procrastination](/procrastinate-effect-1024x683.webp)

Various factors can be the catalyst for the development of procrastination. Work
motivation is influenced by confidence in the success of work, the availability
and size of remuneration, the adequacy of deadlines, and the desire to achieve
goals. Among the main reasons that make you put things off for later, you can
distinguish:

- Lack of confidence in a positive result. When starting any business, a person
  assesses his chances of success. Because of low self-esteem, he postpones the
  beginning of active actions, because he is afraid that he will not do
  everything right.

- Perfectionism, the desire to do everything perfectly. Realizing that he/she is
  not ready to perform the task at the moment 100%, a person stops himself,
  postponing it "until better times".

- Rebellion, disagreement with everyone in everything. Such procrastinators
  deliberately delay work, believing that they will do it better than others.
  But such procrastination leads to the exact opposite result, because the set
  tasks remain unfinished or are done hastily, at the last moment.

- Lack of a sense of the value of work, causing the individual to tend to avoid
  it.

- Physical or emotional fatigue that interferes with the realization of plans.

- Various diseases associated with hormonal disorders, intoxication,
  neurological, mental problems.

Other common causes of procrastination:

- Lack of a sense of time. Thinking that we have enough time at our disposal, we
  fall into a kind of trap. Experiencing a false sense of security, we
  unconsciously delay the deadline. But, the deadline comes unexpectedly and
  unnoticed.

- Overestimating your capabilities. At the first glance at a task, it may seem
  that its fulfillment will take a little time. After all, you can write a
  simple article in a couple of hours or do a term paper in a few days, right?
  In fact, these processes take much longer. Without understanding all the
  peculiarities of the task, it is difficult to evaluate it objectively.

- Waiting for "inspiration" or "working mood". Some performers believe that any
  work should be approached in the right mood. But some tasks, especially
  difficult or unpleasant ones, it is better not to put off for later. After
  all, if you have to do them in a hurry, it will certainly not add motivation
  or pleasure.

### Mental causes of procrastination

The tendency to procrastinate is not a disease. Under normal circumstances, it
is a variant of the norm. But in some situations this phenomenon is considered a
symptom of serious mental and psychological disorders, for example:

- Depression accompanied by loss of energy, development of feelings of
  helplessness, insecurity.

- Obsessive-compulsive disorder arising against the background of progressive
  perfectionism.

- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, which causes a person to be
  distracted by internal thoughts or the environment, making it difficult for
  them to accomplish any task.

These diagnoses are made only by a physician, after a physical examination.

### Consequences of deferring cases

Being prone to procrastination has many negative consequences:

- Decreased self-esteem;

- Increased anxiety, restlessness;

- A life of constant stress;

- Setbacks at work and at school;

- Occupational burnout.

To avoid these problems, let's understand how to deal with procrastination to
eradicate it from your life for good.

## How to fight procrastination: popular methods and techniques

![How to fight procrastination](/procrastination.webp)

First of all, what you need to do is to deal with the reasons for its
occurrence. You should deal with unfulfilled tasks as you would with old things
that have accumulated in your attic: sort through the shelves and throw away the
excess. To a large extent, procrastination is not related to productivity, but
to emotions. Therefore, you need to find a way to manage them competently,
controlling your actions and behaviors.

Train yourself to see failures or mistakes as new opportunities for growth.
Imagine the positive changes that will happen to you if you overcome them and
solve the tasks successfully. Assess their relevance and usefulness. Make to-do
lists, including tasks that you keep putting off. Set deadlines for them, add
20-30% of time to reserve so you don't fall into a cognitive trap. Organize them
into discrete milestones. Come up with a small reward for yourself for achieving
each one.

Use popular time management techniques:

### Eisenhower matrix

The method will help to properly organize and structure things both by priority
and by due date. Divide all current tasks into groups:

1. Important and urgent;

2. Important but not urgent;

3. Not important, but urgent.

4. Not important and urgent.

First of all, start performing actions from the first category, then switch to
the second, third group, and about the tasks that are in the 4th you can simply
forget and without remorse to postpone "for later".

### Eliminating distractions

Everyone's favorite chronophages: that social networks, that messengers, and
also we should not forget about movies, talk shows or TV series, which
constantly distract us from important things. For successful concentration on
work it is convenient to use the Pomodoro method. Break down your work processes
into 25-minute segments, scheduling 5-minute breaks between sessions.

### Immediate fulfillment of unpleasant but important tasks

In time management, this technique is called "eat the frog". Its authorship
belongs to Brian Tracy, a Canadian motivational speaker and self-development
specialist. You create a list of tasks, select the most difficult and important
among them, immediately start it and do it to the end. After all, if you do
urgent and serious things from the very morning, the rest of the day will pass
more calmly.

### Rewarding the achievement of intermediate goals

At the beginning of the road to success, it is difficult to imagine what the
final result will be. But by noticing your small victories, it will be much
easier to maintain enthusiasm and motivation. Noting your accomplishments at the
end of the day will give you an extra push to keep moving forward.

### Right motivation

One of the most effective tools to fight procrastination. Regularly remind
yourself why you need to do it, why you are doing this or that task. Don't use
the phrase: "I have to", replace it with "It's my choice because".

### Formation of healthy habits

You may have to force yourself to do something first. Use your willpower, try to
perform actions regularly. With good self-discipline, it will be easier for you
to concentrate on doing important things.

Make yourself comfortable in your workplace. Put away unnecessary things, put
your phone away. Delegate minor tasks to other people: relatives, colleagues,
friends. They will perfectly cope with them without your personal presence. To
avoid keeping a lot of unnecessary information in your head, use a convenient
task manager, for example, LeaderTask planner.
