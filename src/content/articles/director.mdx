  LeaderTask: Simplify Task Management for Managers. Our crash course helps you
  seamlessly integrate its tools into your workflow
author: src/content/authors/michael-kalashnikov.mdx
---

This practical course was created specially for managerss. If you have a
company, or you are a head of the department, project or direction this course
is for you!

For 10 years of work we accumulated a huge experience of the staff management.
We created our own system of setting tasks and controlling of their performance.
We know how to adopt the system with minimum efforts and do it quick.

Spend 20 minutes on this course. It will help:

- Find out the software features

- Adopt the program without diverting your staff of work (several minutes
  maximum)

- Answer your staff\`s questions about the program

The course saves dozens of hours. If you skip the course and start working in
the program, it is inevitable that questions like "How it works? What for is
this button?" and so on arise. This means that you have to divert you attention
away from work and search for answers in FAQ or contact the tech support. As a
result you waste your precious working hours.

So just try not to divert yourself away next 20 minutes

Let\`s go!

## Step 1

Plan your work: create all your tasks for today and this week in LeaderTask

![director](/director1.webp)

Watch 2 short videos (no more than 2 minutes each one) of how to do this:

Most important:

- Enter everything you have and want to do in LeaderTask. Don\`t keep in your
  mind any task even unimportant.

- Tasks created right now can be seen only by you.

- You can bind a task to a day or several days (for a complex task) but also you
  can leave without a date (drag it in the Inbox or in a project)

- By clicking the tick box in the task field you can select a status to the
  task.

## Step 2

Find tasks which should be performed at a certain time, then drag them to the
daily planner

There is a prototype of the dayplanner in LeaderTask. It helps you to organize
tasks by the time bar. There you can change the task performance period, drag
them at another time and make review of your tasks for several days.

Most important

- If a task has a certain time of perfomance this time is shown in the task
  field (in the list of task)

- You can change the order of tasks in the list but the order in the dayplanner
  doesn't change. And vica versa.

## Step 3

Create accounts for your staff

![director](/director3.webp)

Every colleague gets a message to the mailbox with the data to log in the
program.

Most important:

- Enter real emails

- You don't need to set a complicated password for a colleague. Your colleague
  can change it when logged in.

- You don't need to add yourself (You have already created your account)

## Step 4

Your employees get tasks in LeaderTask immediately and start to perform them.
You can easy control it.

Set all your assignments in LeaderTask. Even the ordinary ones. If you set one
part of assignments in the program and the other part in words you face two
problems: The first one — you are going to have a false picture of your
colleague's activity (the program shows completed tasks, and you can conclude
that only these tasks are completed but in fact your colleague performed much
more). The second problem is that assignments set in word will be for sure
forgotten — lost.

![director](/director4.webp)

Most important:

- Every task should have a deadline.

- If you think that a task can be performed for a period less than one day just
  set a concrete date. This day the colleague enters the program, sees the task
  and performs it.

- If you think that a task is pretty complex and it will take several days to
  perform set a period to this task.

- Any user can assign tasks another user and even you.

## Step 5

Take a look at the employee's to-do list when you see his name marked bold

![director](/director5-1.webp)

If the name of your colleague was marked bold it means that something changed in
one of his or her tasks.

Look at the to-do list and find the task marked bold. Something changed right in
this task. The figure above: a colleague set the status "In progress" (green
triangle) and leave a comment (the icon of cloud to the right).

Enter the task and read the comment.

![director](/director6-1.webp)

Then write down an answer immediately.

Most important:

- Discuss all tasks right in LeaderTask. Use the panel "Discussion". If you
  discussed the task in word and didn't write down the main information just in
  few days you can recall just a part of information or even nothing.

- The performer should write down all steps of performing the task in the
  Discussion.

- Don't delay answers on your colleagues\` questions. The sooner you answer them
  the sooner the performer goes to the next step.

## Step 6

Find out why the task was overdue

If the performer will not complete the task at a concrete date you find it out
immediately. All overdue tasks are shown in your list of tasks for today.

For example, you assigned a task to a colleague and set a date — the 1st of
September. The employee performs this task. The 1st of September passed but the
performer didn't set the status "Ready". The 2nd of September comes. You enter
the to-do list for today and see that the task you assigned is overdue.

![director](/director7.webp)

This way you can react on the overdue task at once.

Then you should do the following:

- Find out why the task is not still completed — write in the chat (the panel
  Discussion)

- Set a new deadline

Most important:

- Your own task (assigned to nobody) can also be overdue. It happens the same
  way as with assigned tasks.

- If you don't set a date to a task it can't be overdue.

## Step 7

Check results when the task is performed by the employee

When the task completed the performer sets the status "Ready".

As always you see that the name of the colleague is marked bold then you go to
the task wherein something changed and find out that the task has the status
"Ready". The signal for this is the red tick on the task.

![](/director8-1.webp)

Check results of the assigned task.

If everything is good enough then set the status "Completed".

![](/director9-1.webp)

If something is not good enough for you, for example the colleague performed the
task in the wrong way or performed it not in full, please do the following:

- Send the task for correction by setting the appropriate status.

- In the chat of the task write down what is wrong with this task and what needs
  correction

The performer sees that you send the task back, reads your comment and performs
the task as required. Then the performer should set the status "Ready" again.

Most important:

- If you approve the task by setting the status "Completed" you can still send
  the task for correction.

- Try to check results of an awaiting approval task as soon as possible. You may
  have to send the task for correction. The sooner you do this the more chances
  your colleague performs the task before the deadline.
