In order to obtain financing from foreign investors, it is necessary to focus on
the international UNIDO standards. Most banking institutions are also oriented
to these standards. When obtaining subsidies within the framework of state
support, it is necessary to focus on existing financing programs. For example,
to support agricultural production, entrepreneurs or unemployed citizens. Each
program has its own requirements.

## On what principles is built, how to write a business plan

![business planning](/biznes-planirovanie-1024x342.webp)

In order to achieve the planned result, the business plan should be formulated
and outlined as transparently and clearly as possible. The following principles
should be followed when drafting this document:

- **Adherence to a unified structure**. All tasks, instructions, figures,
  calculations in the business plan should be linked to each other.

- **Continuous course of action**. Each new step should be a direct continuation
  of the previous item. This will help to keep track of statistics. It will
  simplify the planning of further actions.

- **Adjustments can be made**. When it is realized that the developed scenario
  is not working as it should, it is important to change the direction of
  movement in time. In case of serious errors or miscalculations, it is possible
  to completely change the data and then recalculate them.

- **Accurate description of all processes**. All qualitative components should
  be quantified. All sections of the document should be accompanied by
  appropriate calculations. Once completed, they should be thoroughly
  double-checked at each stage.

Within the framework of internal and external business planning, certain types
of business plans are developed in terms of meaning, which have their own
distinctive features.

  institution. Demonstrates how profitable the project is. Based on this
  project, the bank determines the repayment period and interest rate for the
  loan.

  sale and the prospects for future owners, which should convince them of the
  feasibility of acquiring the project.

  the initial stages of the existence of the organization or in the process of
  its functioning.

business project visually clear and understandable. It is convenient to use
diagrams and graphs for this purpose. All calculations in the business plan
should be accurate and commensurate. If it covers a large time period, for the
first year it is better to create monthly forecasts. For the next - quarterly.
For the third year, an annual calculation.

Another step on the way to success is the reality, the concreteness of the goals
set. They should be achievable and measurable.

To simplify business planning, to develop calculations more accurate, you can
use special programs, spreadsheets or online constructors.

needs to be done to achieve the set goal. It helps to attract investments and
loans for the realization of a business project.

thoroughness and scrupulousness of the approach to business planning. Therefore,
when performing calculations, analyzing the provided information, it is
necessary to repeatedly recalculate and check each point.

is not necessary to dwell on the design. The main thing is to detail the tasks
of each employee on the way to achieving the goal. An investment business plan
should be drawn up in accordance with the standards and rules applicable to
financial institutions.
