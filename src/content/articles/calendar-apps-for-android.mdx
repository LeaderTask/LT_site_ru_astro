A calendar app for Android is much more functional than the default calendar on
your smartphone. It lets you plan tasks, meetings, purchases and other
activities in a visually comprehensive manner. Plus, you can benefit from extra
features that can differ considerably from one app to another. For instance, it
can be an opportunity to customize the design, set up an alarm, share your
content with others, sync it across multiple devices and many more.

We wrote this article to help you select the best calendar app Android. We can
guarantee the highest quality of the solutions that we'll recommend to our
readers. We tried to take into account the tastes and demands of various
categories of users: from students with a limited budget to permanently busy
entrepreneurs, from people in charge of household chores for a large family to
individuals who require the highest possible security level.

Most titles from our list are full-fledged calendar apps. Some solutions that
we'll mention boast remarkably extensive functionality – and calendars are only
a part of them. At the end of the text, we'll tell you about the products that
can enhance your experience of using the calendar apps that you might be already
accustomed to but find them imperfect. It can be, for instance, an app that lets
you check the contents of multiple calendars in one interface – or solutions
that display the items from your calendar in the format of handy notifications
or widgets.

## Essential Question to Ask About a Calendar App

When comparing different options, it makes sense to ask the following questions
about each of them:

- How much does it cost? Most developers allow users to download their products
  free of charge. However, the functionality of the free version can be limited.
  You might want to upgrade to premium to unlock extra features or get rid of
  ads. The most common pricing model is a monthly or annual subscription. As an
  alternative, some solutions offer in-app purchases that extend their
  functionality. Besides, you might be able to buy a lifetime license for your
  calendar app once and forever.

- On which devices can you install it? Some apps are compatible only with
  smartphones. Others let you install them on tablets as well. You might be able
  to sync the contents of your calendar with your computer too if the chosen app
  has a web version or a version that is compatible with the operating system on
  your computer.

- Do you like its design? The major current trend is a minimalistic design, not
  overloaded with details. However, some people prefer oldschool interfaces that
  they got accustomed to years ago. Plus, a part of the audience appreciates
  fancy designs. Ideally, you should be able to customize your calendar's looks
  and choose from multiple themes and views.

- How easy is it to create and edit events? You should be able to perform any
  task within the app in a couple of clicks. Otherwise, the process of adding
  and editing the content might take you more time than what you'll save thanks
  to the app.

- Does its functionality suit your purposes? Do you want to share your tasks
  with others, prioritize them with tags and color-coding, set up reminders for
  them, use widgets and so on? Which extra features do you consider must-haves
  and which seem excessive to you? You should never overpay for the
  functionality that you don't need because there are so many other products on
  the market. Neither should you compromise on your own comfort, for the same
  reason.

Now, let's get down to our rating!

## 1\. LeaderTask

![LeaderTask](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.8

👍 The best aspect: Awesome design and usability

👍 The worst aspect: Lack of opportunity to send messages offline

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: From $3.33 per month

It's a powerful and versatile solution, perfect for managing tasks, products and
projects. It's equally suitable for an office manager, a private individual or a
team of an art studio. Its UX/UI is stunning and its learning curve is
surprisingly shallow. Just as all the other components of LeaderTask, its
calendar is highly customizable. You'll be able to number its weeks to track the
progress of achieving a goal – or to collaborate within a team according to the
SCRUM methodology.

You can use [LeaderTask](/downloads) as a free calendar app for Android if
you're planning to deal with no more than 100 tasks at a time. After upgrading
to premium, you'll be allowed to handle more to-dos, attach files to them, make
them recurring and add notifications to them. Regardless of the chosen plan,
nearly all functionality of the app will remain available after you go offline.
The only thing is that you'd fail to send messages offline – but they will be
transferred to the recipients as soon as you restore the connection.

## 2\. Google Calendar

![Google Calendar](/Google-CalendarAndroid.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.7

👍 The best aspect: Opportunity to automatically pull data from other Google
solutions

👎 The worst aspect: Substandard visualization for multiple events, planned for
the same time

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: It's free for personal use

Years ago, this solution was not too user-friendly. However, its current version
is aesthetically pleasing and functional. It smoothly integrates with the other
products of the same brand, which simplifies the process of planning your
activities. When you add an event to your schedule, the app will suggest
locations, names and contacts to you, based on the data from your other Google
solutions, including Gmail. The calendar can automatically add relevant
information to your events – or you can ask Google Assistant to do it. The
notification bar of this app deserves special praise – with its help, you can
conveniently add events and reminders. Please mind that the interface can get
cluttered when you add too many events.

## 3\. DigiCal

![DigiCal](/digical.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.6

👍 The best aspect: Opportunity to import third-party calendars

👎 The worst aspect: Ads in the free version

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: It's free with in-app purchases

This app visually resembles the previous one. It lets you comfortably plan your
activities for many weeks ahead, add notifications for events and switch between
various views. There is an opportunity to add widgets to your home screen and
import third-party calendars. To explain the meaning of importing, let's imagine
that you like a specific singer and would like to attend some of their concerts.
You can import their tour schedule in DigiCal and select an event that suits you
best, analyzing it in the context of your other upcoming to-dos. You won't have
to add each leg of the tour separately and manually.

The paid version of DigiCal includes such add-ons as weather forecasts and a
heat map that helps you differentiate busy periods from free ones. If you find
these features excessive, you might want to upgrade to premium nevertheless – to
get rid of the annoying ads in the free version, which is the main shortcoming
of the app.

## 4\. Proton Calendar

![Proton Calendar](/proton-calendar-1024x512.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.6

👍 The best aspect: Exceptional safety

👎 The worst aspect: No chance to exchange data between several apps

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: It's free

While some apps on the market mimic Google Calendar, Proton acts as its
opposite. It doesn't integrate with any other products and won't share the
contents of your calendar with them, which is great for security reasons. The
information about your events will be thoroughly and automatically encrypted.
However, you'll still be allowed to invite others to them – even if they don't
have this app.

Some might say that integration with other apps accelerates the data input
because you won't have to type in everything manually. To solve this issue,
Proton offers natural language processing. Its interface is clean and it's a
pleasure to work with it. To display tasks on your phone's home screen, you can
resort to the agenda widget.

The Proton ecosystem includes an email service, a VPN and a cloud storage. It's
a well-known brand among companies and individuals who strive to keep their
connections and conversations confidential. Besides, it's a firm favorite of
people who dislike the idea of feeding advertising giants with their personal
details. In the end, Google shows ads to its users based on the contents of
their apps and earns money on it.

## 5\. Any.Do

![AnyDo](/anydo.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.6

👍 The best aspect: Versatile functionality

👎 The worst aspect: Steep learning curve for some users

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: From $5 per month

This product is popular for task, product and project management. The calendar
is only a small part of its potential, masterfully blended with the
functionality of a planner and a to-do list app. When you add a task to your
to-dos, it will be automatically displayed in your calendar – and vice versa.
You'll be able to sync your content with various third-party calendars and share
them with other people.

On the flip side, some users say that it takes them a bit too long to get used
to Any.Do. The smartest way out is to stay focused only on the calendar at the
beginning. Then, start to explore all the other tools step by step.

## 6\. Calendar by Calendar Date

![Calendar](/CalendarDate.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.5

👍 The best aspect: Simplicity

👎 The worst aspect: Dull name

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: It's free

When you want to google this app or tell your friends about it, it will be
mandatory to mention its developer. Otherwise, its name can read and sound
misleading because of being too generic. Apart from this marketing detail, it's
hard to find fault with the product. It resembles Any.Do – but it's not as
feature-packed and thus simpler to use. The design is minimalistic and the
functionality is focused exclusively on the calendar features, without product
or project management tools.

## 7\. Business Calendar 2

![Business Calendar 2](/Business-Calendar-2.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.5

👍 The best aspect: Flexibility

👎 The worst aspect: Better suits business users than private individuals

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: It's free

As its name suggests, the primary target audience of this app is business
people. However, private individuals can benefit from it too. You can use it as
your main calendar – or sync it with the other solutions that you're already
using. At the bottom, there is a menu bar where you select which calendar to
open.

The app's design is pleasing to the eye. The selection of tools includes
reminders and notifications, thanks to which you'll never miss a to-do. You'll
be able to switch between various calendar views and invite others to your
events.

## 8\. Simple Calendar

![Simple Calendar](/simple-calendar.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.4

👍 The best aspect: Ease of use coupled with decent customization

👎 The worst aspect: Lack of smart suggestions

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: From $2.99 per month

It's one of the components in the Simple Mobile Tools ecosystem which comprises
a music player, an SMS messenger, a dialer, a voice recorder and other
solutions. They're open-source and won't bother you with popups or ads.

The name of this product speaks for itself. It's genuinely intuitive – but at
the same time, offers awesome customization opportunities. You'll be able to
customize the themes of the app itself and the widgets that it offers. Please
don't expect an extensive range of features – for example, the lack of smart
suggestions is one of the reasons why this app is not on the top of our list.
But you can use Simple Calendar offline and share your events with others,
either in private messages or on social media.

## 9\. aCalendar

![aCalendar](/acalendar.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.4

👍 The best aspect: Rich features combined with flexible customization

👎 The worst aspect: Integration only with Google products

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: It's free

The key drawback of this app is that it integrates only with Google products. In
all the other aspects, it performs very well. To add an item to your calendar or
edit it, it's enough to long-press or tap the screen. When you decide to
color-code some information, you'll be able to choose from dozens of shades.
Plus, you can benefit from seven widgets and even check the moon phases right in
the app. As a cherry on top, all these opportunities are available at no cost.

## 10\. Calengoo

![Calengoo](/CalenGoo.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.4

👍 The best aspect: Very few limitations

👎 The worst aspect: Overwhelming customization

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: From $5.99 per month

When using other apps, people tend to complain about their limitations. The
competitive edge of Calengoo consists in its versatility. It can make nearly any
wish of yours come true – from creating to-do lists to integrating with various
third-party solutions. It boasts over 30 widgets, while most of its competitors
hardly have a dozen. You can customize so many aspects of this app – which seems
awesome for some users and overwhelming for others.

## 11\. TimeTree

![TimeTree](/timetree-1024x567.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.3

👍 The best aspect: Excellent sharing functionality

👎 The worst aspect: Not suitable for complex business tasks and projects

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: From $4.49 per month

It's an ideal option for those who want to share their plans with their family
members or friends as well as for event organizers. It enables you to do so not
on a one-off basis but permanently. It offers a dedicated chat room for each
event. You'll be able to divide your contacts into groups and launch a calendar
for each of them.

## 12\. One Calendar

![OneCalendar](/OneCalendar-1024x640.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.5

👍 The best aspect: Opportunity to access the contents of multiple calendars
through one interface

👎 The worst aspect: Not too rich in features

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: It's free

This product allows you to merge the contents of your multiple calendars into
one. You'll be able to check them separately through the same interface – or let
the app list all your plans together. In itself, One Calendar lacks unique or
sophisticated features. You may prefer to compose and fine-tune your schedule in
other apps – and then, switch to One Calendar only for the purpose of reviewing
everything.

## 13\. Microsoft Outlook

![Microsoft Outlook](/Microsoft-Outlook-1024x656.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.4

👍 The best aspect: Opportunity to manage your schedule and emails from the same
interface

👎 The worst aspect: It's not a calendar app in its pure form

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: It's free for personal use

Is Outlook actually a calendar? Technically, not – but you can use it to access
the contents of your calendar and various email services. It's a worthy way to
save time and effort. Recently, the Microsoft team concentrated on upgrading its
mobile apps. In the case of Outlook, the result is very impressive, so you may
want to give it a try.

## 14\. Calendar Notify

![Calendar Notify](/calendar-notify.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.5

👍 The best aspect: Nice and functional notifications

👎 The worst aspect: It's not a calendar app in its pure form

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: It's free

It's not a calendar app – but a solution that can turn the information from your
calendar into notifications. They will pop up on your phone's display to briefly
inform you about your plans. You'll be able to see them even on your lock
screen, which is especially good for busy people who check their schedules on
the run. To access the detailed data about an appointment, it's enough to swipe
down. This app syncs with many different calendars that by default lack
notifications.

## 15\. Calendar Widget by Home Agenda

![Calendar Widget by Home Agenda](/Calendar-Widget-by-Home-Agenda.webp)

💌 Overall score: 4.6

👍 The best aspect: Chance to check your agenda without opening a calendar

👎 The worst aspect: It's not a calendar app in its pure form

🏳️ Upcoming expenses: From $1.99 per month

It's a worthy alternative to the previous one. It lets you check your upcoming
tasks and events without opening your calendar app. You'll see elegant widgets
on your smartphone's screen and will be allowed to customize them to a great
extent. You can add these widgets to events from many different calendars that
you might be using simultaneously. Moreover, it's not necessary to remain logged
in to one account – the widgets can collect data across multiple accounts.

## Final Thoughts

An Android calendar app can make your life much more organized and enjoyable.
Such apps are available in multiple varieties: from the ones with the basic
functionality to powerful solutions, suitable for teamwork and business
purposes. Besides, there are apps that let you manage multiple calendars or
display their contents in a more comfortable manner.

In our opinion, LeaderTask is one of the most noteworthy products in its
category. Its calendar is incredibly user-friendly and there are many other
functions that you can benefit from when planning your activities and achieving
your goals.
