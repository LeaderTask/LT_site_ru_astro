Have you ever had this happen to you? You planned important things from the
evening, for example, to finish a quarterly report. In the morning you came to
work with a firm belief to finish them, but then you got distracted by
something, postponed them for some time, then for tomorrow. As a result, the
deadline for the report is tomorrow, and you have complete chaos in your head.
You try to quickly add up the figures, nothing works. The result: the report is
not submitted on time, and you get a penalty from your boss.

The habit of putting off doing important things "for tomorrow" is called
procrastination. Sometimes this condition is mistakenly confused with laziness.
Someone believes that it arises due to lack of motivation. In fact, this is a
serious problem that can grow into a dangerous addiction that destroys a
person's personality. Let's try to understand how to get rid of procrastination,
why this condition can't be cured by "getting a grip", and what ways really help
to overcome procrastination.

## What it is and how it differs from laziness

Procrastination refers to putting things off "for later", leading to problems in
work and life, to the development of chronic stress, loss of performance, and
lower self-esteem. The term was first used in the Oxford Dictionary in 1548.
Literally, the word is translated from Latin as pro - "instead of" and
castinus - "tomorrow". In the 20th century, the problem of procrastination began
to be considered on a scientific level. However, there is still no clear
explanation of the cause of this condition.

Some people equate procrastination with laziness. In fact, these states cannot
be called unambiguous. A lazy person spends time in rest and relaxation, while a
procrastinator actively spends his energy on secondary, unimportant matters,
instead of channelling it in the right direction. The main cause of laziness is
inertia, indecisiveness, lack of initiative. Lazy people do not take on serious
tasks because they do not want to be responsible for their fulfilment.

Procrastination is a loss of motivation. A procrastinator does not refuse from
the assigned task, but does not hurry to start its fulfilment due to the
inability to assess its real complexity and volume. A kind of conflict between
intention and action (I want to do it, but I can't) is formed in his head. A
lazy person will refuse such a task without thinking about its complexity.
Physiologically, this process looks like this:

- A person thinks about an unpleasant matter - because of this there is
  excitation of the pain area of the brain.

- To get rid of the "painful sensations" he switches to something pleasant.

- Experiences temporary relief as a result of getting rid of discomfort.

Procrastination is an emotional reaction to accumulated tasks. It can be
relaxed, when a person is distracted by something pleasant, or tense, when work
does not start because of insecurity, dissatisfaction in oneself. This is not a
disease, not a sign of weak character. In some ways, this state is similar to a
bad habit, which over time can become permanent. If you let this process "on its
own", do not make attempts to fight procrastination, it sooner or later leads to
sad consequences: loss of work, lower self-esteem, dissatisfaction with yourself
and your life, chronic stress or depression.

## Causes of Procrastination

![Causes of Procrastination](/prichiny-prokrastinatsii-1024x540-1.webp)

To defeat procrastination, it is important to understand what causes it. There
are quite a few of them. No one can work throughout the day without
interruptions. Rest and distraction from business need everyone. But everyone
spends a different amount of time on idle pastime. To the most obvious and
common causes of procrastination can be attributed:

- **Low self-esteem**. The performer delays performing the assigned task because
  he/she is afraid of performing it incorrectly, poorly.

- **Natural perfectionism, the desire to do everything perfectly**. Not
  understanding how to give out the very, ideal, the best variant of solving a
  task, a perfectionist prefers not to undertake it at all.

- **Fear of standing out among others, the desire to "be like everyone else**".
  This reason comes from childhood, when children are often imposed certain
  patterns of behaviour, non-compliance with which is frowned upon and condemned
  in every possible way. The phobia of success is no less evil than the fear of
  mistakes and failures. To become successful in life - means to attract
  attention to themselves. This entails great responsibility, risk. Therefore,
  the procrastinator subconsciously postpones serious matters that can bring him
  to a new level. He prefers to tread quietly and imperceptibly in one place.

- **Unwillingness to obey**. If the performer does not agree with the assigned
  task, it seems to him useless, stupid - he will have no desire to fulfil it
  quickly. Procrastination can also be a sign of hidden anger, dissatisfaction
  with the actions of management. Here is a simple example: your boss promises
  to appoint you the head of an interesting and promising project. You develop a
  strategy, prepare a plan of action, anticipating active and well-paid work.
  But suddenly everything changes dramatically. A new manager comes to the
  project, and you will have to work according to his plan, which is inferior to
  yours in many respects. There are two ways out of this situation: talk
  directly about the problem with your superiors or sabotage the project by
  devoting your working time to browsing the Internet.

- **Lack of meaning in the work**. Meaningless, empty tasks inspire disgust in
  performers. It is foolish to engage in work that has lost all meaning. Up to a
  certain time, of course, you can gather "will in a fist" and force yourself to
  work, but sooner or later it gets boring. If your work has become meaningless
  and useless for you, it is time to change it.

- **Fatigue, overwork**. When your resources are depleted, it is difficult to be
  active. Therefore, important tasks are put off "for later".

Occasional procrastination rarely indicates a serious physiological problem.
Most people procrastinate:

- **Thinking that they still have plenty of time at their disposal**. At the
  beginning of the job, deadlines seem far away, there is time, there is no need
  to worry. But haven't you noticed that deadline always comes unnoticed?

- **Reassessing your strengths and capabilities**. Report due at the end of the
  week? That's a lot of time! I can do it in a couple of hours, a day at the
  most. In practice, it turns out that you don't have all the raw data at your
  disposal, the employee who was supposed to provide important information is on
  sick leave. The deadline is tomorrow and you haven't even started work.

- **Waiting for the "right mood**". Some performers believe that it is
  absolutely necessary to wait for a conscious desire to start work. Without
  inspiration, motivation, there is nothing to even take up the task. But if the
  task is routine and boring, it is unlikely to visit you. And to do unpleasant
  work in a hurry, under threat of punishment from the bosses - such a pleasure.

Whatever the cause of procrastination, it usually has a common scenario. You
need to do something important (submit a quarterly report, talk to your boss
about a pay rise, go to the doctor for a check-up). Because of this, negative
thoughts and emotions arise (you are anxious, nervous, afraid or embarrassed).
This leads to an internal conflict: you should do it, but you don't want to.

## What types of procrastination exist

![What types of procrastination exist](/vidy-prokrastinatsii-1024x564-1.webp)

There is a conventional division of procrastinators into two types:

- Passive, putting the task off because of decision-making problems;

- Active, who do not start work purposefully. Pressure is a kind of challenge
  and stimulus for them.

Psychology distinguishes the following types of procrastination based on
behavioural styles:

| Perfectionists                                                                             | Dreamers                                                                                                                                                  | Restless                                                     | Crisis makers                                                                                                         | Unruly                                                                                                                                                                   | The obsequious                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Put things off for fear of doing them perfectly.Their main fear: not meeting expectations. | In their picture of the world there is calmness and harmony. But in order to solve real problems, they have to work hard, which makes them uncomfortable. | Panic-stricken fear of change that will disrupt the routine. | Need pressure because of an impending deadline. These people do the work on the last night before the project is due. | They refuse to fulfil tasks assigned to them by someone outside. This is a kind of demonstration of their own power. They promise to do something but "forget" to do it. | Ready to do a lot of different tasks to get approval from their superiors. But it rarely comes to their fulfilment. The main thing is to make the right impression on the management. |

The human brain is cleverly constructed. If the imminent punishment for failure
to do his assigned work is postponed, he feels that he has invented an ingenious
way out of the situation. He avoids unpleasant work and also enjoys being
distracted by other things.

Another classification of procrastination was suggested by psychologist Stanley
Milgram. He divided it into:

- Domestic, related to putting off household chores around the house (like
  cleaning or taking out the rubbish);

- Neurotic, with postponement of vital decisions;

- Academic, or procrastination of academic tasks;

- Decision procrastination, accompanied by procrastination in making choices
  when the right information is available;

- Compulsive, representing a learned type of behaviour.

### What are the consequences of this condition

If you do not overcome procrastination in time, it will lead to a number of
negative phenomena in life:

1. Your self-esteem will be permanently lowered.

2. You will experience anxiety, stress.

3. You will have problems at work or in your studies.

4. You will feel burnout, loss of interest in life and the work you do.

People who are prone to chronic procrastination can be compared to those who are
in deep depression. They cannot start doing anything, even the simplest things.
It seems to them that they will not succeed, because of this there is a sense of
guilt, shame for their worthlessness. In order not to sink to such a level, it
is important to overcome procrastination and start working. In mild cases,
sometimes a "magic kick" from colleagues or relatives or your own motivation is
enough. A chronic, neglected form of procrastination must be dealt with step by
step, moving progressively from stage to stage.

## How you can beat procrastination

![How you can beat procrastination](/kak-pobedit-prokrastinatsiyu-1024x682-1.webp)

So, let's look at some simple actionable tips on how to get out of
procrastination.

1. Recognise the problem and stop criticising yourself. Without understanding
   its seriousness, you will not be able to cope with this condition. If the
   process has started far enough, you will not do without the help of a
   psychologist.

2. Plan, make daily to-do lists. This is a simple but effective way of
   self-organisation.

3. Motivation to get things done. You need to understand the benefits you will
   receive if they are successfully completed.

4. Be open to change. Acknowledging a problem will do nothing if you don't take
   the next steps to fix it. Be willing to move forward in small steps.

5. A diary of plans and achievements. This is an excellent tool to help you
   overcome laziness and procrastination. In it, outline prospective and daily
   tasks, assign time for their fulfilment. Try to turn the process into a game
   so that it doesn't seem boring and routine.

6. Detail and analyse tasks. This will help you break down complex tasks into
   simple processes that you can do without difficulty.

7. Start tasks immediately, without waiting for a favourable time. The
   timeframes set in your plans should be respected and adhered to.

8. Determine for yourself that the discomfort of having to do unpleasant things
   is temporary. It will pass quickly, and you will have a finished product on
   your hands.

9. Use the 15-minute rule. Determine for yourself that you will devote this time
   to uninteresting work, even if you don't want to. If at the end of this
   period you also have no incentive to continue, look for the reason. Perhaps
   it's just fatigue.

10. Take failures lightly. They are inevitable. It is a natural process that
    provides valuable experience.

11. Think positive! All thoughts about the possible termination of the planned
    event, exclude as destructive and negative.

## Conclusion

Procrastination is a natural condition that many people on earth are prone to.
There is nothing wrong with occasionally taking your mind off important matters
and relaxing a little. But if this process grows into a habit and then into a
chronic addiction, it leads to very sad consequences.

Remember that all successful people are always active. To achieve certain
results in life, you should not put off work "for later" or stop at what you
have achieved. Set realistic, ambitious goals and strive to achieve them. When
this behaviour becomes a habit, you will feel a surge of energy and optimism.
