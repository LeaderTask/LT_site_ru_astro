## Plan all day

Your main weapon is time. They need to manage them as productively as possible
to achieve great results.

In planning we recommend:

1. Allocate 8 hours to work.

2. 8 hours - for rest.

3. 8 hours to sleep.

Start planning your day.

## 1 hour - 1 task

Break down your tasks into subtasks so that each task does not last more than 1
hour. You can do this in the section of a week sprint:

1. Make a list of key tasks for the week ahead.

2. Define the duration of each one.

3. If you will fint out tasks that last more than 1 hour, break them down into
   subtasks.

4. Determine the duration of each subtask.

5. If there are subtasks that exceed 1 hour, split them into subtasks, too.

## Always plan an extra 15 minutes

If you make a plan for 1 day, try to add 15 minutes for each task.

How to be organized is not a rhetorical question, but a specific manual to
action, as you can see.

## Use time-management techniques

Time management is the science of managing your time. Use one of the time
management techniques to keep your productivity growing.

1. Gantt chart.
