Are you looking to assess the effectiveness of your human resources potential
and personnel management system within your enterprise, but unsure about how to
proceed? Do you find yourself puzzled about the foundations, methodologies, and
key metrics to use?

We will provide you with a comprehensive guide in today's article, detailing
precisely these aspects. Additionally, as a bonus, we will suggest an online
program suitable for automating this process and optimizing cost-efficient
efficiency evaluations.

## **The Essence of Personnel Management Effectiveness Assessment**

What is the core of labor performance evaluation? Firstly, the assessment of
personnel management effectiveness is an ongoing, clearly defined process aimed
at establishing the costs and benefits of human resources. It involves aligning
their outcomes with the results of labor activities of competing enterprises and
considering the past performance of the reviewed firm.

Quality of work assessment enables judgment of individual employees'
performance, their project accomplishments, as well as the collective efforts of
the entire team. When evaluating team performance, criteria such as the volume
of work accomplished, the complexity level of assigned tasks, the specific
functional and organizational responsibilities, and the achieved results are
taken into account.

It's worth noting that various stakeholders, including employers, top-level
managers, and business owners, have an interest in evaluating and researching
effectiveness. Different supervisors often assess their employees' effectiveness
differently in various companies: some utilize KPIs, others consider the number
of closed deals, and some base their evaluations on subjective preferences.
Nonetheless, every leader has their own method, evaluation policy, and approach.

**Objectives of Performance Evaluation**

The evaluation of managerial workforce effectiveness serves a purpose beyond its
apparent need. It's conducted by a company's leadership to shed light on several
crucial aspects:

1. **Quality of Management System**: This includes the system's functionality,
   the organization of functional responsibilities among employees, and the
   effectiveness of distribution.

2. **Project and Task Accomplishments**: Assessing the quality and quantity of
   projects and tasks executed by individual team members.

3. **Employee's Value to the Business**: Recognizing an employee's contribution
   to the collective mission and their significance within the organization.

4. **Work Volume Alignment with Compensation**: Evaluating whether the volume of
   work completed justifies the compensation received by subordinates.

5. **Effective Employee Motivation Methods**: Identifying strategies that
   effectively motivate the company's personnel.

6. **Employee Prospects for the Organization**: Assessing an employee's
   relevance to the organization's interests, the necessity of investing in
   their training and professional development.

In essence, employers seek to understand how their systematic investments in
personnel, such as salaries, bonuses, training, and social benefits, align with
the profit derived from each individual team member. It's crucial to see that
the invested resources continue to yield returns. This perspective is relevant
both in the context of state-owned enterprises and private businesses.

**Indicators of Employee Management Effectiveness**

The primary indicators of any enterprise's productivity include the quantity,
quality, and efficiency of employees' work. The latter component consists of
worked hours, volume of work accomplished, number of served clients,
manufactured products, or processed information, depending on the business
sector (e.g., tourism, management, sales, etc.).

The required level of labor productivity is not a static figure. It depends on a
series of factors, principles, and methods that are equally influenced by both
the team member themselves and their immediate supervisor. Let's delve a bit
deeper into this topic.

**Mutual Willingness to Work**

A regular employee will never exert the necessary and directed effort if they
don't understand the purpose of their exertion. Therefore, a manager seeking
maximum effort from every subordinate should explicitly outline the potential
rewards awaiting productive staff members. These rewards could encompass
bonuses, social benefits, career advancement, status, and more.

With proper motivation in place, everyone benefits. The employee improves their
financial standing and ascends socially or in their career. Simultaneously, the
company reaps greater profits by utilizing each workforce unit effectively.

**Utilizing Subordinates' Personal Needs for Enhanced Efficiency**

Beyond status and finances, each employee has personal interests that led them
to join a particular company and assume a specific role. Managers or HR heads
need to understand their staff members' personal motivations and problems to
leverage them in the company's favor.

**Management's Investment in the Team**

Feeling significant within the team is as essential a motivation factor for
personnel as personal interests and financial gains. Every team member wants to
feel indispensable to the company. When management is invested in their
performance, appreciates their efforts, and respects their work, employees tend
to be more responsible, ensuring they do not disappoint or fail the
organization.

**Challenges of Implementing an Evaluation System**

Not every company possesses a successful employee evaluation system. Various
reasons contribute to this, including poorly chosen methods, ambiguous functions
during formation, immature technology, ineffective management, and insufficient
measures.

Let's explore the main challenges encountered when striving for an ideal
implementation of an evaluation system for assessing the level of employee task
execution efficiency:

1. **Resistance from the Workforce**: Employees may resist new procedures and
   changes, fearing increased responsibilities coupled with decreased
   compensation.

2. **Complex or Multi-level Evaluation System**: A confusing or multi-tiered
   evaluation system can confuse the workforce, leading to demotivation and
   negative attitudes toward their roles and tasks.

3. **Unclear Compensation System**: If the compensation system is unclear,
   employees lose their bearings and are uncertain about what to pursue to
   improve their financial standing.

4. **Significant Disparities in Evaluation**: Discrepancies in evaluating
   completed tasks and overall performance between team members and their
   supervisors can arise.

5. **Goal Achievement Not Dependent on Employee Performance**: There might be
   situations where an employee's efforts don't directly correlate with the
   achievement of goals.

6. **Excessive Time Spent on Mechanical or Meaningless Tasks**: For instance,
   having to write numerous reports could divert time from meaningful work.

In general, the key problem in implementing evaluation often lies in excessive
subjectivity among management, lack of transparency, or unfair assessment
methods, along with the lack of recognition for employees who genuinely deserve
appreciation.

**Work Quality Evaluation Methods**

As previously noted, the primary criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of
collective task execution encompass the organization's ultimate profit and the
motivation, activity, and willingness of employees to work within the
organization.

However, any competent manager must realize that even the highest profit does
not guarantee that no unproductive personnel exist within the team, masking
themselves behind more efficient colleagues. Thus, in addition to tracking the
company's profitability, it's recommended to conduct individual check-ups on
each subordinate to determine their personal contributions, potential, external
factors, and internal motivations.

The professional level of staff is determined through analysis of two criteria:
the theoretical knowledge of company employees and their ability to apply this
knowledge practically.

Specific employee evaluation can be conducted using various methods, but the
most popular are certification, testing, target management, and performance
management. These methods can be applied individually or collectively, as either
one-time or periodic evaluations. Let's examine each approach more closely.

**Certification**

For this method, a special committee is often formed, consisting of judges with
expertise, knowledge, and skills from different fields. This committee assesses
the level of professionalism of not just one, but several specialists within the
company.

Evaluation is based on criteria such as the theoretical knowledge of the team,
their ability to apply this knowledge in practical company activities, alignment
of team members with their positions, professions, and specialties.

**Testing**

Tests offer the advantages of speed, ease of selection and administration, and
reliable results. Test programs are often used during candidate selection
processes and for the intermediate assessment of permanent staff.

**Target Management**

This method involves the objective evaluation of an employee's social efficiency
and analysis of their work during their service, as well as whether their role
aligns with their occupied position.

Managers set several tasks for the staff, assigning precise deadlines for their
completion: a day, a week, or a month of intensive work. Tasks must be clear,
specific, and achievable. Employee opinions about strategic and tactical aspects
of work are considered, and numeric and economic criteria of the plan are
coordinated.

**Performance Management**

This evaluation technique examines the work of human resources from different
departments of the company, entails setting tasks, and monitoring their
effective completion by team members. Performance management essentially
enhances the methodology of performance appraisal and competency assessment.
Each employee is interested in promptly achieving the goals set by management.

The advantages of this technique include stimulating staff to enhance their
professional level, improving work efficiency, and providing an objective
evaluation of how well an individual corresponds to their role.

Within the framework of performance management, the following key stages are
identified:

1. **Preparatory Stage**: Involves developing and refining criteria for
   assessing task execution effectiveness (commonly known as abbreviated as
   KRI).

2. **Organizational Stage**: Encompasses assigning challenging tasks to the
   staff based on prepared KRI indicators, along with possible training.

3. **Assessment Stage**: Involves critically analyzing staff work after KRI
   completion.

4. **Final Stage**: Consists of competency analysis based on obtained results
   and discussions about further development plans.

In addition to the aforementioned methods, other techniques such as role-play,
observation, and biography assessment are widely used. However, evaluating
personnel effectiveness is most conveniently done using specialized modern
online services with numerous parameters and subsystems, considerably reducing
the manager's workload.

## **Effective Personnel Management System: Introduction to the LeaderTask Platform**

An effective personnel management system is crucial for a well-conducted
evaluation within a company, the future productivity of employees, and the
overall profitability of the company. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to
make the right choice when selecting a service that facilitates the assessment
of personnel management effectiveness.

One of the best automated programs available on the domestic market for
evaluating employee performance is the LeaderTask platform—an electronic
assistant and manager designed for executives, individual company employees, and
the team as a whole. Let's take a closer look at this service.

This online application not only facilitates communication with personnel,
delegation of tasks to individual team members, and project management but also
enables the evaluation of completed work, work in progress, and tasks untouched
by subordinates.

The program meticulously tracks the professional activities of each team member,
maintains detailed statistics on employee work within the system, and provides
clear and comprehensive analytics on performance. It showcases the most engaged,
productive, and lagging employees within the company, not only to the firm's
leadership but also to all company employees.

This visualization allows team members to monitor their own and others'
achievements. As a result, each employee strives for excellence, attempting to
achieve the highest performance, complete more projects, and avoid being among
the least productive.

Moreover, LeaderTask includes the following useful tools that can benefit
company leaders:

Additionally, a fully free plan with all essential program functions is
available for those wanting to acquaint themselves with the online service.

In summary, an overall evaluation of workforce efficiency is a crucial indicator
of the overall productivity of a company. Without it, it is not possible to
adequately analyze and assess a company's performance, determine the importance
and necessity of various employees and managers, or judge the inadequate
performance of lazy and unqualified workers.

Every business leader should systematically evaluate employee management
effectiveness. For simplicity and clarity, it's recommended to use automated
services, and one such service is LeaderTask.
