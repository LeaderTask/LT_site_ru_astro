In IT development, flexible Scrum technologies are used for project management.
Such a scheme for organising work in a team is in demand in management and
design. Literally, "scrum" translates as a fight. But not programmers and
developers with each other, but a joint confrontation with circumstances. In IT
this term came from rugby. To win, a team must act cohesively and learn quickly
from previous mistakes. Scrum system is not just a set of rules and rituals that
require mandatory fulfilment. Scrum is a complex system that requires
implementation, organisation and customisation. This is what a Scrum master
does, making sure that Scrum principles are followed.

## Who is a scrum-master and what does in a team

![](/image-65.webp)

A scrum master is not a position, but a role in a framework. To understand how
scrum master helps in a team, let's understand the essence of scrum as a
methodology for working on projects. The term Framework in IT refers to a
template used to write code. Scrum - one of the basics of frameworks Agile,
which is a ready-made model that can be used to customise teamwork.

Scrum is a specific set of steps by which a work plan is built. In practice,
scrum looks like this:

1. Work on any project consists of individual short periods of time - scrum
   sprints - lasting up to a week. Sometimes sprints last two weeks or more.

2. All tasks on a scrum project are put together in a common list - a backlog,
   which is a statement of work consisting of individual tasks.

3. At the beginning of the sprint, scrum meetings are held to sort out tasks
   from the backlog. After Scrum has been successfully implemented in the
   company, scrum meetings become self-organising.

4. Every day, the participants of the scrum project gather to do a stand-up,
   during which everyone answers questions about what they did yesterday and
   what they are going to do today.

5. All project tasks scrum tasks are placed on kanban board. Cards with their
   description are moved in columns when the status changes: "In Work", "To
   Test", "Done", "Finalised". There can be different variants of categorisation
   and implementation of columns.

6. At the end of the sprint, a retrospective is held, where individual and team
   results are discussed, mistakes are analysed, and options for correcting them
   are considered.

Each member of the scrum team plays an assigned role from these three:

- Implementers. They are in charge of the tasks assigned to them (in IT they are
  Developers).

- The management or Product Owner has the overall vision of the product, is
  responsible for its value.

- Scrum master - team leader, coach, builder and process controller. We will
  look at this position in more detail.

The scrum master's main role is to support and ensure the team is running
efficiently between sprints. There is no department head or manager in a scrum
team. From the point of view of Scrum policy, all performers are equal, not
subordinate, but agree with each other. Scrum master ensures comfortable and
productive work of all team members. The Scrum master should help to fulfil the
project tasks, explain the essence of the rules, according to which the
participants have to work.

To answer the question, scrum master, and who is it in simple words, we can say
the following: it is a professional who is fluent in Scrum tools, teaching other
employees to interact properly with each other in a team. A person who performs
this activity within the framework fulfils several functions on the project. But
he cannot be called a supervisor or manager. He should not redistribute tasks
among the performers or influence their decisions in any way. His
responsibilities include:

- Training of performers. The Scrum Master explains the rules and principles of
  flexible methodology to the performers. Explains why they are needed. For
  example, if project participants consider collective discussion of tasks a
  waste of time, the scrum master needs to convey to them the importance of
  these activities.

- Organising group communication or facilitation. Working according to the scrum
  methodology implies regular discussion of work processes. The time of daily
  stand-ups is regulated. It is desirable that their duration should not exceed
  15 minutes, otherwise they will turn into useless discussions. The scrum
  master monitors the course of the conversation, directs it in the right
  direction. All scrum participants should participate in the discussion, make a
  decision jointly,collegiately and share responsibility for it. Scrum
  methodology is based on openness, when each performer can express his opinion.
  This approach to scrum contributes to the formation of a friendly atmosphere
  in the team.

- Kanban board administration. Scrum master tracks tasks that stay in one place
  for a long time, reports it to the executors or the product owner. The scrum
  master analyses sprints and communicates his findings to the rest of the
  participants during the retrospective. This helps prevent many problems in
  their initial stages.

- Mentoring, coaching. One of the important functions of a scrum master is to
  help employees express their thoughts and ideas in communication, prevent
  conflicts within the scrum team. For this purpose, personal or collective
  scrum sessions are organised, where it is decided how he or the whole team can
  help the performer. Feeling constant support, scrum project employees work
  more efficiently. A friendly atmosphere is formed in the team. A scrum master
  motivates his team, which has a positive impact on the self-esteem of the
  participants.

- Improving team effectiveness. Participants should not just follow the rules of
  the framework, but accept and support the values of Scrum. Sprints lose all
  meaning without analysing and discussing emerging problems. Scrum master
  teaches the performers to listen and hear each other, removes from the work of
  the team elements that hinder it and leaves only useful ones. As a result, the
  scrum team works more efficiently and productively.

## What skills a Scrum master should have

![](/image-66.webp)

It is important for a person applying for a scrum master position to have a
certain set of personal qualities and professional skills. What is the first
thing to learn, what skills do you need to become a scrum master?

**Hard-skills:**

1. Scrum master needs basic knowledge of programming, software product
   development. This is necessary to understand the working processes. Without
   an understanding of testing techniques, it will be difficult for the scrum
   master to understand how successful the testing was. For this reason, the
   scrum master's duties are usually performed by one of the team members.

2. Excellent knowledge of Agile methodology and its frameworks. If the Scrum
   master works with multiple teams, it will be useful to learn more about
   scalable frameworks.

3. Knowledge of other project management techniques. This is necessary to
   eliminate unnecessary management techniques from workflows that often
   conflict with each other. This skill is pumped up after a lot of experience
   working with different teams, but there are special training courses that can
   help you quickly learn many of the best management techniques without having
   to rely only on scrum.

**Soft-skills scrum master:**

1. The Scrum Master needs organisational skills to run rallies according to
   approved regulations, to train team members to speak up, to follow the rules
   of the framework.

2. Scrum master it is desirable to have knowledge in the field of psychology,
   for timely detection of problems arising in the team, to eliminate
   disagreements arising between participants.

3. The Scrum Master will benefit from coaching skills, to inspire and support
   team colleagues, motivate development and growth.

4. Mentoring, tolerating other team members to communicate the rules.

5. Open-mindedness, well-developed communication skills that build trust in the
   Scrum Master with other team members.

## **Why do you need this role on the project**

The main task of a scrum master is to make teamwork efficient, organised and
predictable. Participants of the scrum team should get positive emotions from
the work process. Upon its completion, the customer should receive the finished
product within the approved timeframe. Scrum master in the team is a coach, a
technical support representative and a bit of a psychotherapist. Scrum masters
find a common language with developers and business unit of the project, for
example, with sales specialists, knows how to write code.

If a company uses Agile or Scrum approaches to organise work on projects, its
employees are obliged to follow their principles and work with a Scrum master.
His work lasts until the final formation of the team. Some teams take six months
to do this, while others come together and learn Scrum principles in a year or a
year and a half. When the Scrum master realises that the team is working
independently according to the rules of the framework, he can delegate his
responsibility to another member of the team, retaining his advisory function on
the project.

## **What is not part of a scrum master's duties**

Some companies do not fully understand the responsibilities of a scrum master.
Because of this, the Scrum Master is mistakenly assigned duties that do not fall
within his competence. A Scrum Master is not a Jira administrator, office
manager or secretary. The Scrum Master is not a leader or team leader. In a
scrum team, all roles of the participants are equal. The Scrum Master does not
manage the team, but supports and guides it. A scrum master does not select team
members independently. Usually the decision is made collegiately based on the
results of the interview with the candidate.

A Scrum master does not necessarily need to have a programming background or IT
experience. Some teams need masters with skills in certain industries, such as
engineering.

In some teams, the role of scrum master is fulfilled by the sales manager. This
approach is called scrum-bat (scrum, but). It is not popular in pure scrum for
several reasons:

- Product-manager demands fulfilment of his orders, threatening the team with
  sanctions. Scrum master - convinces the team of the correctness of the chosen
  methods.

- A product manager defends the interests of the team and sometimes ignores
  business requirements in favour of development. A separate Scrum master finds
  a balance between the interests of the team and the customer.

Therefore, it is believed that the separate role of a scrum master is more
effective.

## **LeaderTask is a handy project management tool**

To effectively manage teams within a scrum project, scrum masters use various
services, trackers that help to monitor and analyse the progress of
participants. They visually demonstrate what stage the scrum project is at and
what each team member is doing. One of such services is the LeaderTask
application. LeaderTask is a modern, cross-platform online service with a full
set of tools for working according to Agile or Scrum methods. The programme
features a kanban board, calendar, planner, daily planner and project management
system.

The service is convenient to use for formulating and distributing tasks to
executors with control of their due dates. Large-scale tasks can
be decomposed into smaller subtasks. Structure them according to different
criteria: priority, importance, deadlines with the help of colour designations
or labels. Maintain any projects on Kanban e-boards.

For organising rallies and discussing work issues, the app provides a convenient
corporate chat room.

## **Conclusion**

Good scrum masters are in huge demand in today's labour market. The average
salary level for these specialists is from 100,000 roubles and more. To master
this profession it is necessary to develop communication skills, to be able to
work with people, and to have the gift of persuasion. The master cannot be
imposed on the team, appointed directive. He must prove in practice his
importance and usefulness to other participants, deservedly gain trust and use
it prudently.

You can get an idea of what a scrum master does on a project, you can sign up
for specialised courses. If you want to try on this important position, start
with personal psychotherapy with a psychologist. It will help you understand
people better and support them.
