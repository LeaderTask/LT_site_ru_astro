One of the main factors affecting the profitability of any company is the
productivity of its staff. If a business or organization's monthly revenue has
worked "in the plus" and suffered a significant loss in another month, there are
specific, measurable reasons for this. One of them can be considered -
ineffective performance of managers and salespeople. In large companies, it is
physically difficult to track the quality of labor of each employee. Who is just
sitting around, and who is working "for two"? Who should be paid a bonus or
bonus, and who should be fired because of incompetence? To answer these
questions, a special KPI metric is used, which numerically reflects the result
and quality of actions for a certain period of time. Why is it needed and what
does it mean? How is it applied in practice? Let's try to understand and tell
you about the economic importance of this coefficient.

## What is KPI in simple words

![KPI in simple words](/kpi2-1024x372.webp)

The abbreviation KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator. This value
demonstrates the effectiveness in achieving the set tasks and goals. It is used
to track a variety of goals and objectives:

- High level of focus, focusing on overall business performance.

- Low-level metrics that assess the performance of individual processes and
  departments of the enterprise, such as marketing, sales, technical support or
  others. In this case, the metrics are improvised markers of productivity and
  performance of employees. Such a characteristic is calculated for all
  managers, employees, departments of the company. For example, the kipiay of a
  call center operator is determined by calculating the average time of call
  processing or the number of repeated calls from newly returned customers.
  Marketers are evaluated by the statistics of leads attracted over a certain
  period of time, sales managers - by the amount of deals they managed to
  complete with a positive result.

Key Performance Indicator index is effective in various business areas - from
construction and decoration of apartments to management, promotion of the
released product or sales. Sometimes this principle is used to evaluate the
fulfillment of a plan according to a certain planning criterion. This scheme is
also called "management by objectives".

## Why KPI measurement is necessary

Using this indicator of productivity and efficiency, it is possible to measure
and calculate how much financially justified the efforts spent on the creation,
release, promotion and advancement of the product, and what the result is in the
end. The method is necessary to fulfill the following tasks:

- To make a transparent, honest assessment of the performance of an entire
  company and each of its employees. Based on the achievement of established
  indicators, bonus payments are measured and calculated, salaries are
  calculated, and decisions are made on transferring or dismissing personnel.

- Describing and organizing business processes taking place within the company.
  The use of a specific system helps to clearly see who and how performs the
  assigned tasks, what actions each team member is responsible for.

- Strategic analysis and planning, taking into account the company's weaknesses
  and growth points. This option allows to calculate and make timely adjustments
  to the strategy, set new goals and objectives, and reallocate available
  resources.

- Motivating staff to achieve results promptly and quickly. Transparent
  conditions and evaluation criteria will help employees to concentrate on
  important and serious work to achieve success, without being distracted by
  empty, secondary and meaningless activities.

KPIs are taken into account only if they have a direct impact on business
processes or the functioning of the company as a whole. Brief examples: failure
to fulfill the quarterly sales plan or a decrease in the value of orders entails
a decrease in the company's profit. A small number of likes in VK or other
social networks, the number of content views does not belong to these
categories, except in situations where these indicators are key for the company.
But, as a rule, this is very rare.

## Advantages and disadvantages of the system

Personal observations and control by a manager are not always enough to justify
a fair and objective assessment of personnel. Using key performance indicators,
it is possible to get the most complete picture of the activity of each employee
and the division as a whole. The system allows:

- Combine the company's overall development strategy with the results of its
  personnel.

- Improve the overall qualification and professional skills of employees by
  eliminating "weak links".

- Communicate to performers the inevitability of responsibility for their
  actions.

- Improve key performance indicators through partnerships and effective
  collaboration among all labor team members.

The use of KPI methodology helps to develop the most transparent and honest
system of personnel incentives, where the amount of material remuneration or
lack thereof is directly related to the quality of the performer's work. The
availability of verified, confirmed, recorded data or a report on the work
performed will prevent the possibility of unjustified nagging from superiors.

There are also minuses to this business technology:

- It takes a lot of time and resources to implement it.

- It can prove to be a kind of demotivator in teamwork, as each employee will be
  interested in improving and achieving their own results.

- Employees may focus solely on material benefits, which can negatively affect
  the quality of their work.

- Some types of work cannot be deciphered and quantified. This applies to many
  creative professions. Therefore, it is impossible to apply a KPI system to
  them.

In general, it can be noted that this method of assessment is more suitable for
a stable established business with a formalized structure. It is difficult to
use it in start-ups, as they are only going through the initial stages of
forming business processes. Besides, in small companies, employees usually have
no problems with motivation. They actively communicate with each other,
understand where they are aiming and what they want to achieve.Differences
between KPIs and OKRs

As an alternative to key performance indicators, the concept of OKR (Objectives
and Key Results) is sometimes used to motivate employees, which is a
comprehensive goal-setting system consisting of two main elements:

- Global objectives. For example: to make your app the most popular in
  PlayMarket.

- The points that must be passed through to get the planned result. In this
  case, these may be the following points: 1) Clarify interests in the services
  of potential users; 2) Update the interface based on the instruction, trial
  tests and so on.

In essence, these two tools are very similar to each other. The difference
between them lies in the nature of the tasks to be performed:

| KPI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | OKR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Suitable for stable companies with structured, stable processes. This method of assessment is somewhat similar to a to do sheet. Each team member sees his tasks, knows what to do to accomplish them, and simply works in a regular mode. | It implies greater freedom of action. For example, when launching a new product and promoting it on the market. Because of the vague wording, it is more difficult to set KPIs here. But it is quite possible to define the checkpoints that need to be passed in the course of working on a task. |

The OKR technique is not suitable for all teams. There is often misunderstanding
and resistance when trying to implement this metric to evaluate the performance
of rank-and-file personnel. Not everyone is ready to set ambitious goals. For
others, the feeling of freedom of action drives them into a real stupor.
Therefore, when choosing a motivation system, it is absolutely necessary to
calculate what is better in this case: KPI or OKR.

## Types of KPIs

![Types of KPIs](/vidy-kpi-1024x630.webp)

Initially, this methodology was used exclusively in the trade sector, where it
was not necessary to perform complex calculations in order to clarify the
performance of each department or employee. Key Performance Indicator was
determined by the number and total amount of sales. Currently, the system is
implemented almost everywhere. In different areas of business, their own metrics
are used. Conditionally, the classification of key performance indicators is
divided into two large groups:

- Forward-looking, aimed at designing future processes. When setting them, they
  are oriented on forecasts. Examples from sales: conversion at different
  stages, number of calls.

- Resulting or lagging, which are general plans for attracting customers,
  profit, turnover. They are set based on the analysis of past results.

KPIs are divided into internal and external KPIs according to their scale and
sphere of influence. The first ones are used to assess the company's internal
achievements. This category includes product quality criteria, staff turnover,
the size and list of advertising costs, and other criteria directly related to
productivity growth. With their help, the business can forecast results and set
new goals.

External indicators are a summarized expression of the results of the activities
of the business units responsible for achieving the company's overall goals. For
example, expanding its target audience or entering the international market.

There is also a division of KPIs into absolute and relative metrics. Relative
metrics interact with each other and other metrics, and are expressed in
percentages or fractions.

Absolute indicators exist in isolation and are not compared to anything.
Example: the amount of net profit for the sale of office supplies in thousand
rubles or the company's net profit for September. They have a numerical
expression.

## Application of KPIs in different business areas

Different industries have their own specific metrics that determine a company's
performance and efficiency.

### Internet marketing

The indicators valid in this area are not related to personnel activities. To
calculate them, data obtained from end-to-end analytics is used. Usually Google
Analytics are used for this purpose. The indicators include:

- ROI, which reflects the return on investment. It shows how much the company's
  investment in advertising has paid off. This metric is one of the most
  important indicators analyzed by Internet marketers. If the ROI is more than
  100%, it indicates that the advertising costs have been fully recouped by
  attracting new customers.

- ROMI, return on marketing costs. It is determined by the formula: (Profit -
  Marketing Expenses) / Marketing Expenses × 100%.

- CTR is calculated as the percentage of clicks on an ad. This parameter is used
  to evaluate creatives.

- The number of leads is determined by the number of times a company is
  contacted after running an advertisement or promotion.

- The cost per lead is the quotient of marketing costs (net advertising budget)
  to the number of leads. It means how much it cost the company to make calls or
  requests on the website.

### Sales

This is where the quantity and quality of work performed is assessed. The
following indicators are considered:

- Average transaction period (the time it takes for a customer to move from
  interest directly to purchase).

- AOV (Average Order Value) or the size of the average check per order. It is
  determined by the formula: total revenue/number of orders.

- Number of successfully completed transactions, communications.

- Sales conversion (the percentage of the number of transactions to the number
  of customers or clients).

- Sales dynamics (growth rate compared to the previous period).

- Number of newly referred customers.

## Rules of implementation and calculation

![Rules of implementation and calculation](/raschet-kpi-1024x372.webp)

When implementing a KPI system, it is important to take into account the current
situation of the company. It is not necessary to restructure the entire
operation of the company. It is better to start with a separate division, for
example, sales or sales. The process of introducing new evaluation metrics is
greatly simplified by the presence of a CRM-system, which is used by all
managers. In most cases, these software products already contain indicators that
can be used to determine the efficiency of any business.

To set KPIs correctly, managers should answer the questions:

- What kind of result do you plan to get?

- Why is he important to the company?

- In what ways can it be influenced?

- When can they be considered achieved? How will progress be monitored?

To get the best result when implementing the system, it is important to follow
the following rules:

1. Communicate the personal benefits of the new appraisal format to your
   department heads and key influencers. Emphasize the importance and necessity
   of their cooperation. This process should not be perceived as something
   alien, imposed from above.

2. Switch to the new system in stages.

3. Start with the really important, core performance indicators. Their number
   should not exceed 5 metrics for each division or specialist. Otherwise, it
   will be impossible to focus on the necessary primary tasks.

4. Employees must have the ability to influence the set metrics, otherwise they
   will be meaningless.

5. KPI metrics should be aligned with the company's overall strategy.

6. They must be logical and consistent. Otherwise, the introduction of a new
   system can lead to the exact opposite result: instead of growth, you will get
   a decrease in efficiency. Example: when we set a task for production to
   increase output by 30%, we do not coordinate it with the sales department. As
   a result, the surplus production just sits in the warehouse.

7. The introduction of KPI indicators should become an additional incentive for
   all employees, regardless of their function and position.

8. To successfully execute plans, always incorporate lessons learned from past
   projects and set specific, achievable goals for yourself and staff.

## How KPI are calculated

For the calculation, you can create a KPI matrix in Excel, Google tables or
other convenient program, taking into account the following data:

- Key indicators. They should reflect the efficiency of the company, department,
  employee.

- Bases, minimal results.

- Norms, a binding result that must be, achieved under all circumstances.

- Fact, the actual performance of an employee or department.

After filling in the appropriate boxes, calculations are performed using the
formula:

KPI = ((Fact-Base)/(Norm-Base)) × 100%

#### Example:

Management has implemented key performance indicators in the sales department
with a minimum number of deals: 200, and a target of 250. The manager
successfully closed 270 during the reporting period. His KPI calculation would
look as follows:

((270 - 200)/(250 - 200)) × 100% = 140%.

## Mistakes in the implementation of the methodology

Despite the transparency and accuracy of this assessment tool, some managers
have problems implementing KPI systems in sales, internet marketing,
manufacturing or other areas of business. Usually associated with making the
following mistakes:

- Reducing employee salaries. Even if the bonus percentage of sales is
  increased, it should remain at the same level. Otherwise it will demotivate
  the staff.

- Setting unattainable targets. Realizing that the set goals are impossible to
  achieve, no employee will make efforts to realize them.

- Using random indicators that are not related to the company's activities.

- Entrusting the calculation of KPIs to unqualified performers. Mistakes made
  when calculating points or bonuses can cause serious discord in the team.

- Unjustified complication of calculations, application of voluminous formulas
  not understood by the performer.

## Application of LeaderTask service for tracking personnel efficiency
