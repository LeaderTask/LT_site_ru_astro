To lead your team to success, it is not enough to have professional skills,
experience or knowledge in a certain field. Every manager must be an example, a
leader who can organize, inspire and lead others. Leaders are not followed
because of formal power or authority. There is a real trust and respect for
these people, although these factors are usually interrelated and manifest
themselves through experience, for example in the implementation of complex
projects.

Leaders are not born, but become leaders. For the emergence of important
qualities of a leader, as well as many other skills, it is necessary to develop
and nurture personality. Let's try to tell and understand what are the qualities
of a leader. In what way to improve and form them to achieve success.

## History of the emergence of leadership

The concept of leadership has been of interest to mankind since ancient times.
Many political figures and philosophers of antiquity thought about how real it
was to learn to change the world around them, to persuade and lead people.
Initially it was assumed that for this purpose it was necessary to have an
innate talent. Thomas Carlyle's book, published in 1841, formulated the theory
of "the great man". The philosophical definition was developed and continued by
Francis Galton, who in 1869 wrote the monumental work "Hereditary Genius". In
both works, the idea of hereditary continuity of leadership qualities was taken
as a basis. Scholars argued that the world could be changed only by rare
individuals endowed with the gift of leadership from birth. For example, the
prophet Muhammad, Martin Luther or the famous manager Napoleon.

Then, with the help of psychology, the opposite view emerged: that the necessary
leadership skills can be acquired in the course of life by building
self-discipline, determination and self-confidence. Many modern authors, such as
Stephen Zaccaro, Paige Bader, Carey Kemp and others, argue that although innate
charisma and social skills help to gain respect in society, true leadership
consists of many skills that need to be developed, as well as from various
external factors.

## What qualities a leader should possess

So, we've got it all figured out: anyone can be a leader. But, for this, it is
necessary to have the initial data - a certain set of characteristics and
abilities, which are to be actively developed. Let's consider what qualities
make a person a leader:

1. Solid character. It is he who determines how a person behaves in this or that
   situation. If he allows "weakness" in a difficult moment, people stop
   believing in him.

2. Courage and bravery. In critical situations, you often have to take risks. It
   is not always possible to foresee the consequences of actions taken. But,
   this does not mean that you should passively wait for everything to normalize
   "by itself". Often spontaneous decisions are the most correct.

3. Charisma, inner charm. This key trait can also be developed by following
   simple tips and principles:

- Be optimistic, love life.

- Appreciate every person you have to communicate and work with.

- Give people hope, be convincing in what you do.

- Have the courage to share your best qualities with them.

- Be able to justify your point of view

Charismatic people find it easier to lead any team.

1. Dedication. If a leader knows what he is doing, loves his job and understands
   its importance, his mood will be transmitted to the rest of the team. This
   will make it even more cohesive and organized. People who are dedicated to
   their work are ideal motivators for others. They are trusted, helped and
   followed.

2. Competence. A leader must clearly understand what he is doing and what he is
   striving for. And be able to convince others of this. The team of like-minded
   people and subordinates should have no questions about his qualifications or
   competence. An unseeing leader will not be popular with subordinates. To
   achieve this, it is important to constantly develop in various areas.
   Self-improvement, learn something new, get new knowledge and skills. Bring
   all the started cases to the end. Inspire others and exceed their
   expectations.

3. The ability to find a common language with others. This is necessary in order
   to clearly describe and communicate your thoughts and ideas to your
   subordinates, colleagues and employees, to maintain their enthusiasm and
   motivate them to action. The following principles should be followed to
   develop communication skills:

- Set out thoughts and objectives in simple language.

- When communicating, address specific people. Eye contact is very important
  here.

- Speak the truth, to the point.

- Achieve a response from opponents.

1. A sense of tact towards others. One word can bring you to heaven or kill you.
   That is why every supervisor, manager should be extremely correct in wording
   to all those around him. Respecting the rights of others, sympathizing,
   showing kindness and generosity towards the members of his working team, his
   leader should be able to form a favorable environment for effective teamwork.
   This always yields positive results.

2. Simplicity in communication. People who show arrogance when building team
   management rarely enjoy the trust and respect of others. Often these
   qualities hide the lack of proper qualifications or banal insecurity. The
   same applies to the tasks set before the performers. They must be extremely
   clear and understandable both for the management and for each participant in
   the work process.

3. Self-organization and self-discipline. A true leader is able to focus in
   critical conditions to make the right decisions. Does not stop in case of
   failures, moves in the chosen direction, overcoming insecurity and personal
   fears.

4. Willingness to take responsibility for their own and others' actions. A
   person who leads people has the mentality of a winner, a mentor. He
   understands his place in life and is ready to take responsibility for his
   actions. A manager with the traits of a leader takes on a case in which he
   understands, and performs it well. Ready to go further than required. Strives
   for perfection, achieving the best result. And, he achieves this result
   regardless of the obstacles or situation.

When discussing what mandatory qualities a leader should possess, optimism,
clarity of mind, logical thinking, fairness, ability to share experiences,
honesty, openness, flexibility and perseverance should be added to the list.

## Modern types of leadership

![Modern types of leadership](/liderskie-kachestva-1024x410.webp)

There are several approaches that consider certain types of leadership and their
associated management styles. It is worth listing some of them.

### Behavioral leadership

This term refers to the style of communication with subordinates and followers.
The most whole objective classification of behavioral leadership styles was
proposed by Kurt Lewin. It includes:

1. Authoritarian style. The main thing that distinguishes it is single-handed
   decision-making with strict control over the fulfillment of tasks, without
   taking into account the interests of the team. Using this style of
   leadership, it is possible to perform an increased amount of work in limited
   time. But, authoritarian leadership negatively affects the psychological
   environment within the group, reduces the motivation and initiative of
   participants.

2. The democratic style is based on joint decision-making, distribution of
   responsibility for work among all team members. Tasks in this case are
   performed at a slower speed. But, the group works in an atmosphere of freedom
   and benevolence, which contributes to the adoption of original and creative
   solutions.

3. The liberal management style consists in the almost complete absence of
   influence of the manager's authority on the decisions made by the team. He
   plays the role of an observer, watching the work process "from the
   sidelines". This significantly reduces the speed of task fulfillment. Liberal
   management does not dispose to active work and leads to regression.

### Situational leadership

This concept was developed by Paul Harsey and Kenneth Blanchard. Its main
message is the need to vary management styles depending on the motivation and
level of employees. According to this theory, a leader can choose:

- Indicative leadership, in which the leader decides all issues independently.
  Possesses sole power, to which no one has the right to claim.

- Mentoring style based on persuasion and motivation. The leader in this case
  can be compared to a sports coach managing a sports team.

- Supportive management style is based on the leader's active participation in
  the process of forming ideas while giving the group freedom and independence.
  He is an equal participant in the team.

- Delegating leadership, when the leader forms the idea of the project and
  entrusts its realization to the team. He has a strategic and coordinating
  role.

### Emotional leadership

This theory includes six styles proposed by Daniel Goleman, Richard Boyatzis and
Annie McKee. It is based on the impact on human emotions. According to the
concept, leadership is divided into the following styles:

- Visionary. This style is convenient for developing new directions and forming
  a vision of the future. The leader specifies goals, and the team independently
  chooses ways to move towards them. Causes inspiration.

- Coaching. Helps to "pull up" employees who are lagging behind. Provides them
  with support and advice. Under his guidance, subordinates feel cared for. This
  contributes to increased interest in work and better motivation.

- Democrat. It is indispensable in teams consisting of highly qualified
  specialists. He helps to make joint decisions, correctly prioritize tasks,
  taking into account the opinions of the team. With him, team members feel
  their importance for the project.

- Commander. This style is more appropriate for crisis situations. It implies
  making unpopular decisions for the sake of business. Under such leadership,
  subordinates may lose initiative and feel apathy.

- Host. He is attracted to achieve quick results. He is active, mobile and makes
  quick decisions. He sets a high bar for performers and participates in all
  work processes himself. This style can lead to emotional burnout and nervous
  exhaustion of employees.

- An affiliative leader gives those around him a sense of cohesion and energizes
  them with optimism. Resolves disputes and unites the team.

In today's business environment, three more types of leadership are being
considered:

- Attributional. The leader observes the behavior of subordinates. Based on his
  observations, he builds relationships with each of them.

- Charismatic. Based on the manager's personal qualities and management style.

- Transformative. The manager combines personal goals of employees with the
  interests of the company. Stimulates subordinates for development, convinces
  them of the importance of the tasks to be performed.

## How to learn to be a leader

To develop leadership skills at the first stage, you need to soberly assess your
abilities, capabilities, resume, strengths, emotional intelligence. Develop
these skills, bring them to perfection. The following rules will help in this:

1. Plan all activities on a daily basis. Distribute current tasks with a certain
   amount of time allocated for their realization. Take time to make a plan in
   the evening and stick to it during the next day.

2. Control and manage your emotions. Do not get excited over nothing. Make all
   decisions in a calm state.

3. Take responsibility for the actions of the team. Ensure that delegated tasks
   are carried out. Take timely action to correct any problems that arise.

4. Take care of your appearance and image. The way you look, talk and behave to
   others forms your image in the eyes of others. A poorly groomed, insecure,
   rude and illiterate person does not inspire confidence in others. If you have
   no experience in public speaking, enroll in public speaking courses.
