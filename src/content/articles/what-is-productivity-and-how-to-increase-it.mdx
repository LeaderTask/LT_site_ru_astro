Do you work hard, do not allow yourself to relax during the working day, but at
the end of it you are horrified to notice that most of the tasks are left
unfinished? Then it's time to think about improving your productivity. First of
all, you need to figure out how to accomplish more in less time. By choosing the
right tools and instruments, you will understand in which direction you should
move in order to quickly outperform your more successful colleagues or
competitors.

## What is productivity in simple words

In order to understand what actions you need to take to be more successful and
less tired, first of all, let's understand the concept of "productivity". What
is it? And how does it affect the work of each individual employee, department
or company? Especially since there are many articles and books on this topic.

How to characterize productivity in simple words? It is an assessment of the
results of an activity, a person, a company, an industry. Initially,
"productivity" was used in agriculture to select elite specimens of animals
characterized by excellent health and giving strong offspring. From there, the
concept moved to industrial production. "Productivity" in industry denotes the
volume of products produced per unit of time. Example: a company owns two
conditional factories "A" and "B", producing certain products. Plant "A"
produced 150 units of products in a month, and 250 units of products came off
the conveyor belt of plant "B". That is, it was more productive.

Productivity is measured in corporations, departments, and employees to evaluate
their own achievements, both at work and in everyday life. For example, today
during your morning jog you managed to cover 5 miles. Yesterday during the same
time you ran 4 miles. That is, your productivity has increased.

The answer to the question of what is productivity in work is given by a simple
formula: It is Minimum time spent + Maximum results achieved.

In production, in business, this indicator can be easily assessed by focusing on
the amount of products produced or growing profits. The labor of a particular
person is measured not in the amount of profit, but in the ability to rationally
deal with his abilities and talents inherent in nature.

Any labor can be considered productive when:

- The person gets job satisfaction.

- It is performed in a professional and quality manner.

- The performer is not afraid to take initiative in the work.

- The employee is not looking at the clock all the time, waiting for things to
  finally end. He is "on fire", striving to perform at a high level.

Productivity of any work does not depend on the amount of time spent on it. For
example, when a manager instructs an employee to make a report by a certain
time, he considers this requirement reasonable. After all, it takes a little
time to make a report. But if you have other responsibilities and more urgent
tasks, you may not be able to complete the assigned work by the deadline. For
this reason, another important indicator is used to evaluate the result - the
efficiency of the employee or labor.

## How productivity and efficiency are related

![productivity and efficiency](/productiv-i-effectiv-1024x642-1.webp)

If productivity is represented as sales revenue from the sale of products, then
efficiency is the amount that remains on hand after paying suppliers, taxes and
other costs. In other words, efficiency is the volume of output after taking
into account costs. To measure efficiency, it is important to consider how the
result was achieved.

Let's go back to the example with the two plants. We remember that plant B was
more productive, producing 250 products. But it had twice as many employees as
factory "A". That is, in the end, if the number of employees at the plants was
the same, plant "B" would have produced only 125 products. It turns out that the
efficiency of plant "A", which produced 150 products, is 20% higher.

Efficiency is also measured as the ratio of the quality of work done to the time
spent on it. Example: two call center employees are assigned to call 100
customers during the working day. The first one called 150 customers during the
day. The second called 300 customers. Both of them achieved the desired result,
but the second one performed the task more efficiently. She made 200 additional
calls, while her colleague made only 50.

Efficiency is important in any job. But you should not fixate on doing your job
perfectly, deliberately raising the bar. Constant concern about quality leads to
insecurity, anxiety and procrastination. The manager's anxiety will be
transmitted to the team. The team members will be afraid to take the initiative
for fear of making mistakes.

In work and everyday life it is important to maintain a kind of balance, working
on both indicators, trying to achieve the goals, soberly assessing what costs
are incurred.

## How productivity is measured

Currently, the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) system, developed by Intel
Corporation, is used to assess efficiency and productivity and has spread quite
quickly in the business space. It is used by large global companies such as
Linkedln or Google, as well as small startups and aspiring entrepreneurs. This
methodology makes it easy to formulate tasks, monitor efficiency, and increase
productivity.

The methodology involves setting Objectives and identifying transitions along
the way (Key Results) to help you make progress. You set desired outcomes,
deadlines and track productivity. This requires serious motivation and a desire
to achieve the planned results.

Key Performance Indicators-methodology or KPI is widely used in many companies
to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of personnel. This is a quantifiable
indicator of actually achieved results. KPI indicators are approved for
individual employees and departments of the company. For example, for a
specialist in the HR department, the KPI is determined by the number of hired
employees who remain in the company after successfully passing the probation
period.

## Factors affecting productivity

So, we've covered what productivity means. It is time to talk about what factors
influence it. First of all, it is the condition of the human body and the
conditions in which it works. It is known that the concentration of carbon
dioxide in the premises directly affects the level of attention and
concentration of employees present in them. That is to say, productivity can be
improved by regularly airing the office and ensuring its quality ventilation.

Another important factor is the level of lighting in the room. If there is
sufficient light, staff experience far fewer problems with eye strain and
fatigue. They experience fewer headaches and therefore work more efficiently and
productively.

The temperature of the air in the workplace has a similar effect on people. If
it drops below 20 degrees, employees make more mistakes. But, if it exceeds 25
degrees, performance also decreases.

To increase productivity, it is important to exercise regularly and monitor the
quality and quantity of sleep. The less sleep a person gets, the worse he
perceives learning and makes more wrong decisions. In turn, quality sleep
together with systematic sports helps to improve concentration, memory, improves
mood and reduces the level of stress, which negatively affects productivity.

## What gets in the way of being productive

Improving productivity is a conscious process that requires time, discipline and
patience. To develop a specific program of action for yourself, you must first
understand what prevents you from working efficiently and productively. Here are
some of the most common reasons:

- Excessive persistence. This important quality is necessary to achieve goals.
  But, when goals lose relevance and importance, some people move towards them
  by inertia, without noticing the change. To avoid this useless activity, it is
  worthwhile to ask yourself from time to time about the relevance of your
  goals.

- Amplification, the repetition of the same actions to make sure they are
  correct. Because of this, energy is wasted.

- Reversion, a return in thought to the past with regret for unrealized
  opportunities.

- Haste, getting ahead of events. When making plans for the future, it is
  important not to lose sight of current events.

Procrastination, constantly postponing work also gets in the way of becoming
productive. Promising that you will do it tomorrow, Monday, January 1, is a
conscious self-deception.

## How to be more productive

There are quite a few effective and real-life ways to increase productivity.
Here are some of them:

- Make plans for the day. If you don't, you will be distracted by extraneous,
  meaningless activities, such as talking to coworkers or looking at email.

- Identify your biological activity peaks. Most people have them in the morning.
  You should plan important tasks that require attention and concentration for
  this period.

- Avoid multitasking. Constant switching between different tasks reduces
  productivity by up to 40%. Therefore, it is better to focus on the main thing,
  without distracting yourself with extraneous tasks.

- Apply time management techniques and tools for self-organization and time
  allocation (it can be GTD method, Eisenhower matrix, Kanban system or Pomodoro
  method).

- Start the day by working on complex tasks. Do small tasks that take a few
  minutes right away, don't put them off until later.

- Put plans in writing and note progress toward achieving them.

- Don't become a slave to gadgets, social media, and conversations with toxic
  people.

- Get enough sleep, take enough time to rest.

- Use reminder programs.

- Be prepared for possible deviations in the plan due to force majeure.

Competently distribute and plan the working day, personal time will help the
strategy MITs. This abbreviation stands for "The Most Important Tasks".

## LeaderTask - a handy tool for increasing productivity

![Best To Do List Apps](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

In the age of digitalization, electronic programs are increasingly being used to
improve productivity. This includes LeaderTask, a modern, functional task
planning application that makes it easy to make plans, monitor their execution
and organize any tasks in a rational way. Track the performance of the team
working on a project and each team member. Set goals, tasks, delegate them to
colleagues and subordinates.

You can evaluate your productivity in LeaderTask on the informative graph, which
shows the number of tasks assigned, completed and not completed on time, and the
time of their execution. One point is assigned for each successfully completed
task. If deadlines are missed or the task is completed poorly, the points are
taken away.

Productivity can be evaluated on various parameters:

- By objectives (general and individual);

- By time (days, weeks, or months).

In addition to the graph, the result can be displayed as a scale showing the
average performance of the user compared to other team members.

To succeed at work, do something you really enjoy. Doing what you love will make
it much easier for you to achieve high productivity. Stop in time. You should
not try to save a project to the end if it is impossible to change something in
it for the better. Analyze the mistakes and move on to successfully complete
another job. Competently distribute your forces, do not be afraid to delegate
and learn to focus on what is important. And, you will notice how it will affect
your productivity.
