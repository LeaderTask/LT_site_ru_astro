goals correctly, select tools for their successful achievement, and manage his
life, abilities, and time competently. For the management of personal activities

of time. But, in fact, this category has a broader meaning. What is
self-management? How does it help to become more successful and manage people,
company or personal life? Let's try to understand it.

## Concept, objectives and functions of self-management

The most valuable resource for a modern person is not money or social
connections. Time is much more important. If you use it wisely and allocate it
to solve vital tasks, your chances of success and career advancement will
increase significantly.

Self-management is a consistent and purposeful use of various methods, tools and
techniques for optimal and meaningful use of time. It is a tool for
self-improvement, self-management and personal development. Rational
self-management is related to human nature (individual, personal factors,
individual genetics), organization (of ideas, things, people or relationships),
and social management.

The main goal of self-management can be formulated as maximum concentration of
all available resources to accelerate various procedures and actions. A person
(manager, manager) should:

- Make 100% use of your time and potential abilities;

- Consciously manage your life and time;

- Overcome any external work and personal circumstances.

Self-management is essential for every person who wants to use their time
efficiently and effectively. It is useful for those who need to improve their
performance. Self-management as a tool for self-organization and personal
development is important not only for managers of companies, managing people. To
achieve better results in work and life, its principles should become a habit.
For this purpose it is necessary to constantly work on oneself, to cultivate
diligence, skills of sober, logical thinking.

The basic theses of self-management are:

- Setting specific, realistic, achievable goals;

- Forming a vision of success in your head (in the form of material well-being,
  environment, health, other important aspects of life);

- Using the "big leap" methodology to achieve goals - start acting as soon as
  possible;

- Belief in your own strengths and capabilities;

- Concentrating on key goals in life (sifting out secondary, unimportant tasks);

- Practice the skill of self-control, even if the experience is unsuccessful at
  first.

Self-management provides an opportunity to effectively use basic personal
resources: time, activity, education, ability to pay. It helps to manage the
processes of life activity due to the rational organization of work and rest
periods. Promotes proper career development. Improves the manager's performance
by raising the level of qualification, developing personal qualities, forming a
positive image in the eyes of the management or potential employers.

managers and ordinary performers a lot of advantages in work and personal life.
Among them it is worth highlighting:

- Rational organization of work, allowing to achieve better economic results
  under normal conditions;

  of the work;

balance between work and ordinary life, to get pleasure and joy from it. A
balanced, self-controlled person has logical thinking, is able to quickly make
balanced decisions, and is better able to cope with stress. He is more useful
and productive as a leader or team member.

## Principles of self-management

The art of self-management helps you achieve your goals faster, regardless of
the field in which they are located. By utilizing its principles in your work or
personal life, you will greatly increase your success and productivity. These
are:

### Systematicity

It is impossible to become the best specialist or manager in a company, earn a
lot of money or radically change one's life all at once. The secret of its
serious, profound transformation lies in the regularity and systematicity of
efforts aimed at achieving goals. In this aspect, self-management is an
improvised circle divided into sectors - steps leading to a certain result. The
goal is set? Then move on to planning your resources and environment. Next,
think of a worthy motivation that will push you to the upcoming success. Are you
sure you'll succeed? Evaluate your achievements and gradually raise the bar.
Acting consistently and purposefully, you will successfully overcome any, the
most difficult path.

### Small actions

This principle can be summarized as follows: don't work too hard to achieve a
goal. Make small efforts, but consistently. If you have set yourself a goal to
start running in the morning, do not set yourself too high requirements. For
example, run 10 kilometers on the first day. The first unsuccessful attempt can
severely undermine your confidence and determination. You will not have the
strength and desire to continue this endeavor. Only as you progress gradually
will you notice obvious progress. Start your workouts with short ten-minute
jogs. Plan them for the same time. After a week in this rhythm, you will notice
how your character and willpower have strengthened. Then you can gradually
increase the workload.

Your key goal should be challenging and ambitious enough. If you view your daily
efforts to achieve it as small steps, don't be lazy, gradually move towards it
with these small steps, it will not seem unattainable and frightening.

### Intrinsic purpose and motivation

To be successfully achieved, global goals must correspond to inner needs and
desires. Deep human needs are always based on two motives: the desire to receive
a reward or to avoid suffering, punishment. Have you decided to finally quit
smoking? Ask yourself a question: why do you want to do it? To avoid getting
sick, to have good teeth, or to get rid of health problems? Or to look better in
the eyes of others, to raise your self-esteem?

Having formed an internal goal in your head, it is easier to decide to take the
first step to achieve it. So be sure to ask yourself: "What do I really want?".

### Inert development

Your main mission is to develop and improve your personality. Don't beat
yourself up for not being able to reach the coveted million subscribers on your
channel or increase your salary level by 100%. Choose a direction that interests
you and develop in it. Learn languages, attend seminars, read books, communicate
with interesting and successful people. If your desire to develop is really
sincere and conscious, all your efforts will help you get to your goal faster.

By working on your habits, attitudes, and emotions, you will achieve
professional and career growth. Remember that your main goal is not to copy
someone else, but to become the best version of yourself.

## Common myths about self-management

The concept of self-management is familiar to many people. Nevertheless, there
are no more successful and productive people. As before, they prefer to "go with
the flow", believing that they will not be able to change anything in their
lives. In this regard, certain myths related to this tool of self-management
have arisen.

### Myth 1: Self-management is only necessary for managers. As long as I haven't become one, it doesn't concern me

This statement is very far from the truth. Without learning how to allocate your
resources and opportunities competently, you will never be able to move up the
career ladder! Without showing yourself as a person who effectively manages
himself, you cannot claim to manage other people.

The main benefit of self-management is to master the skill of consciously
managing work and life processes. The ability to overcome any external, internal
obstacles on the way to the goal. It is of practical benefit to any person,
whether a salaried employee or an entrepreneur. Learning to manage yourself,
your abilities, talents, time, you will achieve your goals faster. You will feel
satisfaction from the work done. Make sure that your time and efforts are not
spent in vain.

### Myth 2: Self-control is necessary in critical or emergency situations. It is of little use in life

Will you be able to explain yourself fluently in another language in a foreign
country if you have not studied it before? The situation is similar with
self-management. Like any other skill, the ability to rationally manage your
time, abilities or other resources needs to be practiced. A difficult project,
an emergency at work or in life is not the best time to practice. By pulling
yourself together, concentrating on solving the problem, you will certainly find
a way out of a difficult situation. But, only by turning self-management into a
useful habit and part of your life, you will be able to avoid many stresses, as
you will always know what you need to do at a given time.

Judge for yourself, if this technique works well in critical conditions, why not
adopt it in ordinary life?

### Myth 3: Self-organization cannot be learned. It is either there or it is not

If you have the desire and systematic efforts, you can learn anything. According
to experts in the field of time management - the skills of rational time
management, it is quite possible to hone on courses or independently.

The first option is more appropriate for company personnel. The organization of
corporate classes allows to better unite the team, to eliminate artificial
division due to arising misunderstandings. For personal mastering of the
methodology there is a lot of interesting, informative literature with an
accessible and simple presentation of the material. These are theoretical
publications describing principles and techniques, biographies of famous people
who are guided in life by the principles of self-management.

## Functions of self-management

The daily tasks are closely interrelated with each other. They are carried out
in a certain sequence, forming a "Circle of Rules". It demonstrates the
dependence between the individual functions of self-management. There are six
functions in the outer circle:

1. Goal-setting, clear goal-setting with visualization of the final result in
   real terms. You must understand what result your activity should bring.

2. Planning, drawing up a step-by-step "road map" defining your actions on the
   way to achieving the planned goals. Finding sources and resources for their
   realization.

3. Decision-making. This is done by choosing the most favorable option among
   several alternatives offered.

4. Organization of personal space and working time with the creation of a
   convenient work schedule and strict adherence to it.

5. Systematic control over oneself with analysis of compliance of the obtained
   results with the planned indicators at all stages of work.

6. Working out communication channels and effective communications.

Self-management is necessary to determine the amount of one's resources in
various areas. To be able to manage them competently without damage to yourself
and others. Development and strengthening of internal and external resources to
achieve life goals. Studying options, acquiring new means, qualities,
properties, competencies for development and self-improvement.

## Methods of self-management

Each function has its own objectives and methods of achieving them. Their
interrelation is presented in the following table:

| Self-management                |                                                                                              |                                                                                      |

Let's take a closer look at each of the techniques presented:

### Goal setting

All processes have time constraints, adjusted according to external and internal
factors. In order to set the right benchmarks, it is important to understand
where you are at a given time, where you want to go, where you do not want to be
under any circumstances.

Short-term goals and objectives should be in line with your long-term strategy.
They should be as clear and concise as possible. You can use the SMART method to
set them. According to this technology, your goals should be realistic,
measurable and time-bound, in line with the company's strategy.

### Planning

According to many experienced managers, when effective planning techniques are
incorporated into the self-management of the executive team, any project tasks
are completed quickly and promptly. The 60:40 concept is well suited for time
allocation. Its essence is that plans should be made for 60% of the time, and
the remaining 40% should be set aside as a contingency reserve.

The second important principle to adhere to when making strategic and current
plans is regularity, systematicity and consistency. Plan things regularly,
systematically and consistently to be able to do them well by the deadline.

### Decision-making

When starting to work on tasks, follow the rule of prioritizing them. Important
tasks should be done first. Secondary, unimportant tasks can be postponed or
deferred. Several effective methods have been developed for managers to help
them make quick and competent decisions. These include:

- The Pareto principle (or 80/20 method). In this context, it means that 80% of
  tasks can be accomplished in 20% of working time. But, you should start with
  the priority and serious ones.

- ABB method. Under this abbreviation there are three types of tasks on which
  different categories of performers should work. Type A tasks are solved
  exclusively by the manager. B-type issues are delegated to assistants, and
  C-type tasks are delegated to rank-and-file employees.

The Eisenhower technique is widely used in self-management, which allows for
competent prioritization of tasks. According to this technique, all cases are
divided into the following groups:

- Urgent and very important (the supervisor is responsible for them);

- Urgent but not very important (they are assigned to staff);

- Important, but not urgent (these are performed by the manager, to the extent
  possible, not necessarily today);

- Non-urgent and unimportant (they are postponed for later, performed at will).

### Organization and implementation of the plans outlined

![Organization and implementation of plans](/kalendar-rukovoditelya-1024x372.webp)

This stage includes activities to organize the day's activities. Creating a
schedule, to-do list and tasks. The working day can be divided into three parts:
beginning, middle and end. There are certain rules for the successful
fulfillment of planned tasks and to-do's in these segments:

#### Early in the day:

- Put yourself in a positive frame of mind.

- Start work at the same time.

- Do your planning the night before, do a brief review of your planned
  activities first thing in the morning.

- Prioritize tasks. Always start your work with the important things.

- Coordinate your plans with others involved in the process as needed.

#### In the middle:

- Use logical thinking as you work through the tasks.

- Set realistic deadlines for their completion.

- Double-check your results, monitor yourself.

- Follow the plan, don't give in to sudden impulses to change something.

- Work at a moderate pace, with rest breaks.

- Small, similar tasks, solve in one go.

- Take your work to its logical conclusion. If you get distracted, you will find
  it difficult to return to its completion.

- Schedule time for routine tasks.

- Important and complicated tasks should be done in the first half of the day.
  Simpler tasks can be done later in the day.

- Control the time available to you. Match it to the plans you have made.

- Finish small tasks started in the middle of the day.

- Evaluate the results of the work you have done.

- Make a plan for tomorrow.

#### End of the day:

By the end of the working day, all current tasks should be completed. Remember,
you have the power to subordinate your work, not to submit to it. Therefore, be
sure to adhere to these rules.

## Rules of effective self-management for a project manager

Self-management skills are especially important for managers. Their ability to
organize their working time, space, ability to rationally distribute resources,
and desire for self-development determine the prospect of achieving key
objectives and the success of the project. The following rules will help to
achieve better results in joint activities:

- It is mandatory to record your plans on paper, in attachments or electronic
  documents with a deadline. Based on your to-do list, you will have clear
  instructions describing the tasks that need to be completed by a certain time.

- Break down large-scale tasks into smaller ones. This technique will reduce the
  fear of responsibility. By completing smaller tasks individually, your team
  will get closer to the end point faster.

- Get your priorities right. The most complex tasks require more resources and
  time. Therefore, they should definitely be at the top of the priority list.
  But, small tasks should not be forgotten either. They can be organized in
  between the main work.

- Don't forget to be productive. Working on large, multi-step projects doesn't
  tolerate distractions or inattention. Schedule time for rest and breaks. Don't
  get distracted by social media and messengers. Set aside a separate time to
  check them.

- Set achievable goals for yourself and your team. They should be measurable and
  understandable to each performer.

- Properly delegate authority. Every manager knows that it is impossible to
  solve all work tasks alone. Therefore, all minor tasks should be delegated to
  subordinates.

- Don't forget to get plenty of rest. Without it, you run the risk of developing
  a lot of health problems. This will only worsen the final results.

### Self-management tools

![Self-management tools](/what-about-scrum-1024x479.webp)

To master the art of time, work and life management, there is a whole set of
professional tools. These include:

#### "The Curve of Life"

It is a graph on which all life aspects are marked: positive and negative,
concerning work and other spheres of life. The method aims to get answers to
questions:

1. How have I lived up to this point?

2. What career peaks have you reached?

3. What failures did you encounter? Why did it happen?

4. What age would I like to live to?

5. What do I want now?

6. What challenges and setbacks are likely to occur on the way to achieving
   current goals?

"Curve" shows the point at which a person is at and the extremes they may face.

#### A time line for ranking life goals

Create five key objectives each for different periods:

- Long-term (spanning a lifetime);

- Medium-term (5 years);

- Short-term (one year).

They are then progressively executed, starting with the short-term segment.

#### Analyzing the disadvantages and advantages

By objectively assessing your strengths and weaknesses, you will be able to
determine in which direction you should move and develop. The best qualities
will be your main resource that will help you achieve success, and the weak ones
are a burden that prevents you from moving forward. You need to get rid of them.
