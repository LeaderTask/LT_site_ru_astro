events. Such a solution enables you to arrange your affairs in a well-structured
and visually comprehensive manner. In this review, we'll recommend the best
iPhone apps to you that are indispensable for managing your to-dos.

## How to Select the Best To Do List App iPhone

When comparing the available options, it would be wise to focus on these
parameters:

- Target audience. Some apps were conceived for solo use while others are ideal
  for teamwork. Some were built for managing private affairs and others for
  business – plus, there are versatile solutions that serve both purposes.

- Design. It can be modern or with a charming vintage feel, minimalistic or
  fancy. You might be able to customize it to a small or great extent.

- Functionality. It can be a basic checklist app iPhone – or a powerful platform
  for managing tasks and projects.

- Cross-platform compatibility. The app might let you sync your content with its
  web and desktop versions as well as access it from your computer or another
  mobile gadget.

- Plans. The more flexible they are, the better.

Below, we'll list the genuinely top solutions. All of them have free plans
unless stated otherwise. The functionality of their free versions is more
limited, compared to paid ones. The prices will be indicated per individual per
month unless stated otherwise.

## LeaderTask

![LeaderTask](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.8

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $2.18

👍 Competitive edge: Rich functionality, combined with ease of use

👎 Main drawback: Lack of opportunity to send messages when offline

It's an incredibly popular app with a very diverse audience. Its interface is
eye-candy and it's flexibly customizable in many aspects. It enables you to add
as many tasks as you fancy, create them from emails, sort and filter them, make
them recurring, categorize them with labels and attach files of different
formats to them. The Focus feature will draw your attention to the most
essential to-dos – and the Smart Search will help you promptly find anything you
need. You'll be able to delegate tasks to others and modify access rights to the
shared content. The app lets you assess the contribution of each individual
involved and measure the productivity statistics of the whole collective. You'll
benefit from handy reminders and notifications.

Most features of LeaderTask are available offline. However, you'd fail to send
messages without an Internet connection.

## ClickUp

![ClickUp](/ClickUp_img-1024x680.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.7

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $7

👍 Competitive edge: AI assistant

👎 Main drawback: Lack of opportunity to export dashboards

It's a worthy alternative to LeaderTask. Its interface is nearly just as
user-friendly and its functionality is rather rich too. It will take you minimum
effort to create tasks, organize them into lists, edit them and share them. The
collaboration and customization opportunities of this app are rather decent. It
integrates with many third-party products. To facilitate your workflows, you can
rely on ready-to-use list templates and the AI assistant – the latter can help
you with creating lists and tasks as well as summarizing notes.

If you're planning to use ClickUp as a private individual, you might not fully
appreciate the power of its AI – because it's often easier to deal with the
simplest tasks yourself. As a business customer, you may dislike the lack of
opportunity to export dashboards.

## Todoist

![ToDoIst](/ToDoist-Planner-1024x655.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.7

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $4

👍 Competitive edge: Google Calendar integration

👎 Main drawback: Not too extensive collaboration opportunities

Todoist is popular among families and groups of friends. It's one of the best
simple apps where you can create to-do lists or shopping lists and edit them.
This solution allows you to split tasks into subtasks, assign them to different
people, prioritize them and set deadlines for them. You'll be able to
comprehensively visualize your productivity and integrate your content with
Google Calendar.

The key limitation is that collaboration opportunities are not too extensive.
This app might fail to satisfy the business needs of a team.

## nTask

![nTask](/ntask.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.7

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $3

👍 Competitive edge: Project risk management and timesheet management features

👎 Main drawback: Needs a Slack integration for team communication

This app deserves your attention thanks to its rich task management
functionality. You'll be able to create and edit tasks, merge them into
projects, link them to each other with the help of dependencies, comment on them
and add files to them. nTask allows you to add meetings to your schedule as well
as set notifications and alerts to your meetings and todos. You can conveniently
switch between various types of views: Gantt chart, grid, list and so on. This
app supports project risk management and timesheet management, which makes it
stand out from many alternatives.

On the flip side, the interface of nTask might be not as intuitive as that of
some of its competitors. Besides, it lacks a built-in chat – so you'd better
integrate it with Slack to discuss things with your team.

## Things 3

![Things 3](/things-1024x768.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.6

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $9.99

👍 Competitive edge: Logical interface

👎 Main drawback: Lack of a free version

This one comes in handy for organizing your to-dos into daily checklists,
categorizing them with tags and adding headings to them. You'll be able to set
notifications, reminders and deadlines for your tasks. Things 3 lets you share
projects with others – but not collaborate on lists or separate tasks. You can
integrate it with Slack and other products to conveniently check your calendar
events.

This app lacks a free version. If you'd like to use it as your to do list iPad,
its price will increase to $19.99. The $9.99 price tag is relevant only for
Apple's phones and watches.

## TickTick

![TickTick](/ticktick-app-1024x576.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.6

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $27.99 – it's the price of the
annual subscription that you need to pay in one go

👍 Competitive edge: Voice input

👎 Main drawback: Limited integration potential

Even though this app's interface is a bit complicated, it has many features that
allow you to improve your efficiency. After you compose a list of to-dos, you
can share it with others, group your content into folders and categorize tasks
with tags. Feel free to add regular or location-based reminders to your tasks as
well as benefit from voice input.

To make the most of TickTick, you'll have to upgrade to the paid version.
However, even with a premium plan, you might fail to integrate this product with
third-party ones.

## ProofHub

![ProofHub](/welcome-to-proofhub-526x1024.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.6

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $45

👍 Competitive edge: User roles are not too flexible

👎 Main drawback: High price

The target audience of this product is teams of any size but not individuals.
It's costly and focused on project management. Some people believe its interface
could have been a bit more user-friendly.

ProofHub lets you plan the activities for a group, monitor the progress and
discuss the tasks within the app. You'll be able to split tasks into subtasks,
single out milestones, track their accomplishment statuses and view your
schedule as a Gantt chart. The app allows you to set deadlines for your todos,
pass notes and create events. You can assign personal tasks for each team member
– but the distribution of user roles and permissions is not too flexible.

## Remember The Milk

![Remember The Milk](/remember-the-milk-ipad.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.5

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $49.99 – it's the price of the
annual subscription that you need to pay in one go

👍 Competitive edge: Intuitive and customizable interface

👎 Main drawback: Hardly suitable for complex task management

It's a worthy planner for private users, families and groups of friends. It lets
you create tasks, make them repetitive, assign them to friends or colleagues,
set reminders for them, add deadlines for them, filter them by priority, tag
them and label them. You'll be able to select from diverse color themes and
customize the app. Please mind that only tasks but not reminders can be
location-based.

Remember the Milk can be great for private individuals. However, it's hardly
suitable for complex team collaboration or powerful task management.

## TeuxDeux

![TeuxDeux](/TeuxDeux-1024x627.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.5

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $3

👍 Competitive edge: Minimalistic design

👎 Main drawback: Lack of a free version

This one is famous for its clean interface. You can create tasks, make them
repetitive, compose lists out of them and customize these lists. By default, the
app sticks to the weekly view, displaying every day the items with the highest
priority so that they stand out. To edit the content, you'll be able to use
Markdown. TeuxDeux can remind you about your daily to-dos by email. If you fail
to complete a task today, it will be automatically rescheduled for tomorrow.

As for the shortcomings, this product lacks a free version and its functionality
isn't sufficient for teamwork.

## Toodledo

![Toodledo](/toodledo.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.5

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $2.99

👍 Competitive edge: Decent basic features

👎 Main drawback: Limited functionality of the free version

With this app, you can create to-do lists, tag items, arrange them in folders
and resort to smart sorting. It's rather flexible and can be used for both
private and professional purposes. Besides, Toodledo enables you to develop good
habits.

The free version of this product isn't suitable for collaborating with a team.
Another shortcoming is the limited number of ready-to-use task list management
templates.

## Google Tasks

![](/google-tasks-1-1024x576.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.5

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: There is no premium
subscription

👍 Competitive edge: Integration with the other products by the same brand

👎 Main drawback: Lack of features for complex task management

This brand offers two products for basic to-dos management: Google Tasks and
Google Keep. The latter is better suited for notes, so we'll focus on the former
here. Its interface is minimalistic. You can nearly effortlessly create tasks,
split them into smaller ones, define deadlines for them, merge them into lists
and set notifications for them.

It's hardly possible to use this product for managing complex projects because
it lacks the necessary features. For instance, you can't track the time in it
that you spend on a particular task.

## Microsoft To Do

![Microsoft To Do](/microsoft-to-do.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.4

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: There are no paid plans

👍 Competitive edge: Integrations with other products by the same brand

👎 Main drawback: Limited customization

Previously, an app called Wunderlist was among the most in-demand ones in the
to-do niche. Microsoft acquired it and rebranded it. The new development team
considerably expanded the product's functionality due to its integration with
Office 365. You can create to-dos, merge them into lists, prioritize items and
color-code them. You'll be able to set reminders and deadlines for your tasks,
take notes and track your progress.

Unlike many of its competitors, Microsoft To Do offers only limited
customization opportunities. Plus, you'd fail to create notes with the help of
natural language input.

## Quire

![](/Quire.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.4

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $7.65

👍 Competitive edge: Modern design

👎 Main drawback: Lack of a built-in chat

It's one of the newest items on our list, that's why its design looks so modern.
Here, you can create tasks, join them into lists and projects, make them nested,
add reminders to them, set start and due dates for them and prioritize them.
This app is suitable for group work. It enables you to assign roles and
permissions for each team member, use the Kanban format and deal with complex
workflows.

Unfortunately, Quire lacks a built-in chat and time-tracking features.

## Taskade

![Taskade](/taskade.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.4

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $4 per month for 3 individuals

👍 Competitive edge: AI assistant

👎 Main drawback: More focused on teamwork rather than individual use

This app enjoys high demand among teams who rely on it for completing business
tasks and projects. It allows you to organize your tasks in a well-thought-out
manner and flexibly fine-tune your content. There are multiple tools for
enhancing your productivity, including countdown timers, and for collaborating
with others in real time. The vital competitive edge of this solution is its AI
assistant. It can help you optimize your workflows, write texts and communicate
with others in the chat.

Taskade might fail to impress you if you're planning to use it alone for your
casual to-dos.

## Bit.ai

💌 Rating: 4.4

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $8

👍 Competitive edge: Branding features

👎 Main drawback: Lack of calendar integration

This tool was designed to collaborate on documents. It enables you to research
and organize documents, compose to-do lists and combine them into projects.
You'll be able to create materials for training your staff members and for
sharing with clients. Bit.ai allows multiple team members to edit the documents
collaboratively as well as embed various types of files from over 100
third-party apps. It should be easy for you to manage your content thanks to the
handy folders and library. The smart search function is genuinely helpful. As a
cherry on top, you can flexibly customize and brand your documents.

As for the shortcomings, this app lacks in-built calendar integration.

## Habitica

![Habitica](/habitica.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.3

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $3

👍 Competitive edge: Fancy gamification concept

👎 Main drawback: Not too suitable for business

The target audience of this solution is young and/or fun-loving people who
struggle to develop good habits conventionally and will try to do it with the
help of a role-playing game. You'll start by selecting a cute avatar that will
evolve according to your real-life progress. If you're too slow and inefficient,
be ready to face in-app penalties – and if you're productive, you'll get
rewards. It's a social app that lets you communicate and compare your results
with other users, which can be great for motivation.

Habitica wasn't conceived as a project management solution. Neither its
functionality nor its theme are good for business.

## Workflowy

![Workflowy](/Workflowy.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.3

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $4.99

👍 Competitive edge: Offline mode

👎 Main drawback: Simplistic interface and functionality

It's a rather simple app, perfect for beginners. It enables you to create tasks,
merge them into lists and arrange them hierarchically. It supports detailed and
nested lists – you can add as many of them as you wish and split their contents
into subtasks. You'll be able to take notes, filter and tag your tasks, share
parts of your lists with others and access most features of the app offline.

Apart from that, you shouldn't expect too much of Workflowy. In particular,
you'd fail to benefit from calendar views, reminders or deadlines.

## Bear

![Bear](/bear-1024x613.webp)

💌 Rating: 4.3

🏳️ Minimum price that you should be ready to pay: $1.49

👍 Competitive edge: Rich text editing

👎 Main drawback: Steep learning curve

You might need time to explore the functionality of this app and get used to it
– but it should be worth it. Bear is a note-taking solution that doubles as an
instrument for managing your to-dos. It equally suits the needs of private and
business users. You can create tasks, merge them into lists, add checkboxes to
them, set deadlines for them and categorize them with hashtags. You'll be able
to select from various themes, attach visual files to your text content and
export your plans in multiple formats.

Please note that the free version of Bear is not too functional.
