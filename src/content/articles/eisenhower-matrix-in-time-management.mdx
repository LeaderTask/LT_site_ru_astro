The Eisenhower matrix (or prioritization matrix or Eisenhower square) is an
effective tool used in planning. The method minimizes planning time, makes it
easier and faster.

In today's article we will consider the essence and features of this principle
of time management and find out what its structure is. And we will also learn
what the essence of the Eisenhower matrix is, what criteria it has, how it is
applied at work and at home. We want to understand and tell you how to correctly
set tasks and present ready-made examples.

## What is Eisenhower matrix: definition

U.S. General and politician Dwight Eisenhower was best known as the 34th
President of the United States from 1953 to 1961. The intense activity and
continuous professional employment forced the commander to focus on a variety of
tasks every day.

According to history, in order to optimize this process, the politician came up
with a unique method of time planning, which later became known as the
Eisenhower matrix. Today, this model can be used not only by
commanders-in-chief, but even by ordinary people: managers, employees,
freelancers, housewives. It is a simple but effective way to effectively
prioritize current tasks, quickly put things in order and achieve success.

The meaning of the approach lies in the competent division of tasks: the ability
to understand and distinguish the important and urgent from the less important
and urgent. In addition, with this method, it is possible to significantly
reduce the time spent on unimportant, meaningless activities.

## How to apply the matrix

This popular time management tool helps you to evaluate the importance of your
own daily tasks and categorize them in detail. All tasks according to this
matrix are divided into 4 groups, distributed vertically and horizontally -
importance and urgency. Depending on their intersection, they appear:

1. Group A - urgent and important matters.

2. Group B - non-urgent and important tasks.

3. Group C - urgent and unimportant assignments.

4. Group D - non-urgent and unimportant actions.

Filling in and dividing all tasks into groups allows you to filter out minor and
insignificant tasks that need to be solved, which are important and valuable for
a person. With the help of the matrix, creating lists of tasks becomes easier
and it becomes possible to focus on what is necessary at a given moment.

## Structure of the Eisenhower matrix

It consists of four small fields named A, B, C, D. To build it, draw a square
with four equal sectors. Then make a complete list of actual tasks that need to
be accomplished. After that, the tasks should be distributed into sectors
according to the degree of importance and urgency. In this case, square A
includes urgent and important tasks, B - important and non-urgent, C -
unimportant and urgent, D - unimportant and non-urgent.

### Square A (emergency, crisis)

Quadrant A contains important and urgent tasks that are recommended to be done
immediately, as they become available. In people with time management skills,
this quadrant looks empty most of the time. The constant presence of tasks in
this field indicates that the person has problems with planning, delegation and
dispersal of forces, or incorrect prioritization.

Which cases are usually recorded in field A:

- force majeure;

- health-related;

- having a negative impact on other cases if not fulfilled;

- leading to trouble for non-compliance;

- sudden and favorable opportunities that should not be missed.

In order that the tasks in quadrant A do not arrive, it is necessary to perform
tasks from quadrant B in a timely manner. Also for the fastest resolution of
these tasks, their fulfillment can be delegated, but only to responsible and
trusted people. At the same time, delaying the execution of assignments from
quadrant A is often accompanied by stress, anxiety or emotional "burnout" of a
person.

### Square B (strategic, potential)

This is the most important element that is worthy of utmost attention. In this
field there are things that are necessary and belong to the priority,
perspective and allow a person to develop in the long term. People who devote
the most time to tasks from sector B, organize their lives around them, more
often achieve success in career, move up the career ladder faster, get more
money, live happier and brighter.

This usually includes high-impact cases such as:

- academic, professional and sporting activities;

- self-development and self-education activities (reading, courses, etc.);

- search for new opportunities, personal projects and realization of business
  ideas;

- adherence to an acceptable daily schedule, dietary regimen;

- medical examinations, taking tests and regular check-ups with doctors,
  dentists, psychologists and other specialists;

- planning, analyzing work, etc.

Some things from sector B, which have not been given proper attention for a long
time, can move to square A. For example, if you refuse to go to the dentist for
a long time, you may wake up one day with a very severe toothache that can no
longer be ignored. Moreover, the task risks turning into a problem: the tooth
may completely collapse, rot and require extraction or expensive treatment.

### Square C (sector of disturbances, vanity, illusions)

This field contains activities that keep you busy all the time, but do not bring
you closer to your goal setting or help you to know more, develop and become
better in personal and business terms. These include, for example, tasks such
as:

- mailing out documents, checking e-mail;

- cleaning, cooking, washing dishes;

- repairs, mowing the lawn, fixing an electric stove or washing machine, etc.

Most of the tasks in the third list are the most important part of our life, so
it is not possible to completely disconnect from them. However, when a person
performs mostly such tasks, his dissatisfaction with his life grows and he feels
that he is doing the wrong thing.

Therefore, it is recommended to delegate these tasks to a personal assistant,
contractor, cleaning, repair or delivery service. If reassigning tasks from List
C is still impossible or unavailable for a number of reasons, you should reduce
their impact on your schedule. For example, limit visits to messengers, turn off
notifications, and say "no" more often.

You should also proceed to the tasks from the third field of the table only when
the tasks from the previous two sectors have already been completed.

### Square D (sector of destruction, waste, garbage)

The most paradoxical field in the table, as it includes favorite activities, but
which are of no benefit to the individual. For example, it includes such tasks
as:

- talk on the phone, meet friends in a café, play golf or billiards with your
  mates;

- play a console or computer game, watch a TV show, read a book;

- log into a social network, check messenger, reply to a message, etc.

The desire to be lazy, relax and socialize with loved ones is nice, but is not
practical in the long run, kills time, and prevents you from achieving an
important goal.

Of course, it is necessary to rest, but if these tasks are the majority and the
main focus of the person, he can get stuck in a routine. In this case, the
individual's overall motivation to do something drops, stress, procrastination
and a sense of escapism arise.

The best remedy in this case is to record and identify what from the list in
sector D takes up the most time. And then try to limit or replace it with a more
productive activity, for example, a task from sector B - yoga, meditation,
learning a foreign language, listening to music, sports. A drawing of Stephen
Covey's technique, similar to a coordinate system, is attached below.

## Advantages and disadvantages

U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower's Priority Matrix is a common method of time
management, which, along with other methods of time management, has not only
pluses but also minuses. Let's consider them in a little more detail.

| **Pros**                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Minuses**                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ease of use** - does not require special knowledge, prior detailed training on application;                                                                                                                          | the way only makes sense if one has a daily routine;                         |
| **versatility** - quickly and easily fits into the life of any person, any sphere of activity;                                                                                                                         | is not suitable for long-term planning;                                      |
| **no complexities, no additional tools, no auxiliary settings** - you just need to make a list of current tasks and allocate them to sectors;                                                                          | ranking of current tasks is subjective, so it may be performed with errors;  |
| **instant identification of the right development strategy** - immediately after structuring the tasks by quadrants in the matrix, it becomes clear what needs to be done at a given moment;                           | does not take into account external factors, environment, other people, etc. |
| **quick identification of shortcomings and errors** - immediately after the matrix is created, you will see which cases take too much time or do not need to be solved, taking a lot of time and effort at the moment. |                                                                              |

short-term planning and urgency, but in some cases it will be ineffective. Take
these parameters into account when making the table.
