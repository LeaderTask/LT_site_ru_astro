In serious and large-scale projects, there are no secondary tasks. However,
accomplishing them all simultaneously is physically impossible. There simply
isn't enough time and resources for that. Trying to do everything at once leads
to chaos. You end up working in a rushed manner, adapting to the situation. Yet,
this doesn't always yield positive results. Navigating through the endless
stream of tasks is where task prioritization comes in. It's an effective time
management tool that helps formally determine the importance of each task.

## **What is it for and how does it work**

![goals](/postanovka-zadach-1-1024x468.webp)

Without proper prioritization, there is a risk of starting work with the
simplest and non-essential tasks. This is due to the functioning of our brain,
which tends to be inherently lazy. As a result, truly important tasks get
postponed for 'later.' As the deadline approaches, they are done haphazardly,
quickly, and with lower quality. As a result, the business ends up at a
disadvantage.

Goal prioritization works at all levels of planning. The method is suitable for
organizing daily tasks or developing a long-term strategy. This technique has
numerous advantages:

- Enhances team productivity and that of each team member.

- Helps find the shortest and correct path to the intended goal.

- Ensures efficient distribution of key resources: time, money, materials.

- Assists in bringing order to work and personal matters, achieving life
  harmony.

Setting priorities is like an improvised task filter that sieves out everything
unnecessary. By focusing on key areas of life, you can obtain what truly matters
to you from it.

'Prioritizing tasks' means assigning them a specific place in the overall list
based on the complexity and time required to complete each task. As a result,
important tasks requiring immediate action occupy the top positions. Following
them are tasks that can be deferred for some time. And at the very bottom of the
list are secondary, non-urgent tasks."

## Criteria of prioritization.

![plan](/poshagovoe-rukovodstvo-1-1024x393.webp)

To achieve the set goals in life, it's important to be able to identify the most
important ones among them. There is no universal, standard approach here. Each
situation requires separate analysis and examination. In time management,
priorities are established based on the following criteria:

- **Degree of importance.** This includes goals and tasks that have the
  potential to significantly improve life in a positive way.

An important goal always aligns with core values. For someone aiming for
financial prosperity, the goal of 'launching an online store' or 'attaining a
new position' will always be more relevant than 'developing creative abilities.'
If a goal doesn't align with a person's or a company's values, it won't be
achieved, as its realization won't bring satisfaction.

The same criteria should apply to important tasks. These are a set of actions
necessary to achieve the main goal, designed with specific values in mind. The
primary task for the goal of 'opening an online store' could be 'website design
and development.'

Importance is a key criterion for prioritizing tasks. It directly impacts the
speed and necessity of their completion.

- **Urgency.** Each task has a deadline by which it needs to be completed.
  Violating this deadline can result in missed opportunities, problems, or the
  loss of relevance.

For instance, 'Write a report.' If it needs to be submitted by the end of the
workday, it's very urgent. If the deadline is set for the evening, it's simply
urgent and shouldn't be postponed. If the report needs to be finished by the end
of the week, it's not urgent. The Eisenhower Matrix, a popular time management
tool, is built upon the basis of task urgency and importance.

- **Resource Allocation.** When planning, it's important to consider how much
  money, effort, and other resources are required for each task. As a result,
  the priority is given to the outcome with lesser resource demands.

For example, suppose we want to purchase and install new software. One IT
company offers to do this for $500. Another developer offers the same price but
includes additional features in the service package, ensuring more efficient and
comfortable application use. Naturally, the choice would favor the second
provider.

- **Expected Outcomes.** This criterion determines how beneficial the
  accomplishment of each goal and task will be for the company.

For instance, when planning a social media advertising campaign, a group is
selected for posting. Selection is done from three user groups with identical
interests, engagement levels, and advertising rates. In one group, there are
20,000 members, in the second - 30,000, and in the third - 60,000. To achieve
the optimal result, it's advisable to place the ads in the third group, as the
reach will be higher, positively affecting the click count.

- **Effectiveness.** Based on the previous two criteria, the effectiveness of
  each task is calculated. For this, the anticipated outcome is divided by the
  planned resource allocation.

Returning to the social media advertising example, let's assume that advertising
prices differ between the groups. Using available data, we create a table to
calculate effectiveness:"

Please note that while I've provided a translation, the text contains tables and
specific examples that may need to be adjusted for clarity and formatting in
English.

|           | Audience size | Advertising rates | Effectiveness |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1st group | 20,000 people | $30               | 20            |
| 2nd group | 30,000 people | $50               | 25            |
| 3rd group | 60,000 people | $100              | 20            |

From an effectiveness standpoint, launching the advertising campaign in the
second group will be more advantageous.

## **Effective methods of prioritization**

Various methods of prioritization are employed to accurately determine the
importance and value of goals and tasks. They help structure, visualize the
available data, and efficiently organize work processes.

## **Eisenhower Matrix**

One of the most well-known task prioritization tools used in time management. It
helps identify the importance and urgency of each task without getting caught up
in urgent matters regardless of their significance in the workflow.

According to the methodology, all tasks are divided into four categories:

1. **Important and Urgent:** These must be done immediately.

2. **Important but Not Urgent:** These should be scheduled in a daily planner or
   task list.

3. **Urgent but Not Important:** These should be delegated to others.

4. **Neither Urgent nor Important:** These can be postponed or completely
   removed.

To determine the order of task execution in each group, deadlines can be used.
If actions in the list are equally urgent and important, the complexity of each
task is taken into account when setting priorities.

## **MoSCoW Method**

The principle of this method is based on its abbreviation. The word 'MoSCoW'
stands for:

1. **M (Must):** Denotes tasks of high importance and top priority. These are
   tasks that cannot be postponed. They are essential for product launch and
   release.

2. **S (Should):** Includes tasks that are not of high importance but are
   mandatory to complete.

3. **C (Could):** Encompasses actions that are desirable to execute within the
   project.

4. **W (Would):** Contains non-urgent tasks that are not essential for the
   workflow. These can be comfortably postponed without harming the project.
   These tasks can be used for long-term product development strategies.

This method is optimal for internal company projects.

## **Kano Model**

Developed by Noriaki Kano in 1984, this prioritization method employs a
coordinate system where the X-axis represents the level of task execution, and
the Y-axis represents the degree of customer satisfaction from their completion.
Kano utilizes three quality criteria that influence customer satisfaction:

1. **Basic Needs:** These are fundamental properties of a product or service.
   Customers perceive them as a given and taken for granted.

2. **Performance Needs:** These are qualities that directly impact customer
   satisfaction and contribute to competitive product characteristics.

3. **Excitement Needs:** These are unexpected features that significantly
   enhance the value of the product. Customers are pleasantly surprised by these
   bonuses.

Using this tool allows for a more accurate and comprehensive characterization of
each task and helps prioritize tasks while considering the expectations and
preferences of potential users.

## **Two-List Method**

This tool, developed by the renowned investor Warren Buffett, is based on the
Pareto principle. Its essence: out of 100% of planned tasks, only 20% are truly
productive, contributing to 80% of the results.

To utilize this method, create a list of 25 planned tasks. Choose the five most
important and prioritize them. These will form a new list and should be
completed first. The remaining 20 tasks can be tackled when there's available
time and appropriate resources.

## **Using LeaderTask for Task Prioritization**

Main LeaderTask Screen By learning to prioritize correctly, one can achieve
better results in work and life. Modern digital services like the LeaderTask
electronic planner are currently used for effective planning.

The program makes it easy to create task lists and edit the tasks within them.
Tasks can be removed or moved with a single click. Tasks can be grouped by
importance, execution dates, and assigned priorities. Delegating tasks to other
team members within a project, monitoring the degree and quality of their
completion is also possible.

Smart notifications keep you informed about important tasks. The electronic
assistant timely reminds you of upcoming events and significant dates. Statuses
like 'In Progress,' 'Completed,' 'Canceled,' and 'Ready for Submission' aid in
task management. You can attach files and comments to tasks and discuss work in
a shared chat. The app operates across all digital platforms.

## **Conclusion**

Utilizing modern methods of task prioritization allows effective organization of
collaborative projects within a team, enabling each participant to maximize
their potential. With these methods, crucial and high-priority tasks can be
identified, yielding the best results and contributing to business growth and
continued success
