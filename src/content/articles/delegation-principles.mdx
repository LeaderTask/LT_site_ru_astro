According to the famous business coach Stephen Covey, the term "delegation of
authority" is the highest form or element of managerial activity. According to
statistics, only up to 10% of managers use their time effectively. The rest are
engaged in tasks that could be delegated to others.

With the development of business, the number of responsibilities assigned to
managers is constantly increasing. If you do everything without delegating it to
anyone, you run the risk of burnout and chronic stress neurosis. So if you want
to do serious work and accomplish great things, learn to delegate your tasks to
your employees.

How to competently delegate authority to subordinates in order to increase the
company's profitability and become more successful? Let's deal with this
question in more detail.

## What is meant by the concept

Delegation is the process of transferring certain functions of a manager to
subordinates. This is necessary to achieve the overall goals of the company. The
essence of delegation is to determine the limits of access and responsibility of
each employee. The meaning of the concept is that the manager delegates certain
tasks to subordinates so that they can make better decisions in their area of
competence. By assigning a task to an employee, the manager frees up time for
global strategic matters related to the development of the company. The
delegation of certain powers to personnel can be one-time or permanent.

The hiring interviews should be conducted by the hiring manager. Tax
calculations and preparation of typical financial reports should be left to the
accounting department. The use of delegation of authority will reduce the risk
of deadlines on projects in the company. This will improve the efficiency of the
company and all its employees.

If most of the work tasks are tied to one person, it can be dangerous for the
company. If the manager is fired or becomes ill, the whole team will suffer.
Therefore, it is necessary to resort to the practice of delegation. Competent
assignment of tasks helps to achieve the following goals:

- Free up management resources for cases where they cannot be replaced.

- Raise the skill level of subordinates. By taking responsibility, they will be
  able to learn something new.

- Improve the psychological climate in the team. By understanding the motives of
  supervisors, workers will be more conscientious of their authority.

- Test the abilities of your staff. By assigning certain responsibilities to
  employees, you can assess how well they can handle them. Based on this
  assessment, make an appropriate decision.

- Reduce the burden on management.

- Increase the productivity of each work unit.

- Increase staff commitment to labor.

By removing unnecessary responsibilities, the manager will be able to engage in
creative and strategic work that will increase the status and success of the
company. With the help of delegation, quality employment of lower-level
employees is ensured.

## Principles and methods

Proper assignment of tasks increases the company's efficiency by 30-40%. The
following principles of delegation of authority are based on this:

- **Unity of command**. Assignments are delegated directly from the direct
  supervisor to the employee. The CEO delegates authority to the deputy. The
  latter gives instructions to middle managers. They delegate tasks to their
  subordinates. Ordinary employees receive orders from their supervisors.

- **Restrictions**. A supervisor may only give assignments to his subordinates.
  Each department head is assigned a limited number of employees. He cannot
  delegate a delegated task to other subordinates.

- **Respect for rights and responsibilities**. Employees may not perform tasks
  that are not in accordance with their job description.

- **Assignment of responsibility**. By delegating a task to a subordinate, a
  supervisor is not relieved of responsibility in case of its non-fulfillment.

- **Transfer of responsibility**. When giving an employee an assignment, the
  boss must be sure that he can fulfill it.

Use these simple principles of effective delegation in your team. By setting
deadlines, you will be able to control the task at every stage. Choose the right
person for the job. Assign tasks to those who are ready and able to take them
on.

## Why delegating is so hard

Delegation of tasks has disadvantages - the possibility of barriers in
communication between the manager and the subordinate, if the need to delegate
authority has not been defined taking into account the needs of the organization
and its goals. Lack of delegation of authority can occur if the boundaries of
responsibility are not defined.

There are objective reasons that prevent managers from delegating authority to
their subordinates. These are:

1. The desire to demonstrate oneself as a generalist. Previously it was thought
   that a good manager should be able to act actively on "all fronts". And to
   communicate with clients, and to select goods, and to think through
   advertising. This model has not been used even in small businesses for a long
   time. Everyone should be engaged in their own business, without being
   distracted by secondary matters.

2. Fear that workers will fail to complete a task and have to redo it. Or damage
   to the company. This minimal risk has a right to exist. In any case, you can
   avoid it altogether or minimize it by carefully choosing who to assign tasks
   to.

3. Complexity. A person cannot be put in front of the fact that he is obliged to
   do this or that job. He must be trained and assisted.

The delegation of authority is carried out from the manager to one employee,
which means that assigning one task to a group of executives is not allowed.
When giving an assignment, it is important to describe the essence and
boundaries of the task precisely so that the employee can understand his area of
responsibility.

## Rules of delegation

Delegating tasks implies the introduction of time management principles into the
company's management structure. In order to make the delegation process
organized and successful, you should adhere to the following rules:

- Before assigning an employee to a new task, make sure he understands its
  nature and can handle the assignment well.

- Don't look for a replacement. Focus on the professionals.

- Use a vertical management structure with division of the company's main
  activities. Each level should have its own manager.

- Don't be afraid to empower your subordinates. If they ask questions about a
  task before you do it, ask them what they would do in that situation.

- Do not try to control every little detail. This approach can cause your
  employees to lose initiative and responsibility. So you will take everything
  on yourself again and resent the fact that "no one does anything without you".
  Pay great attention to this rule, because this factor can affect you both
  positively and negatively.

Explain the area of responsibility to the employee. He must understand which
issues and tasks must be approved on a mandatory basis. What problems must be
solved independently. Learn to clearly state the task, requirements, goals and
deadlines. Respond if you are approached for help. By giving feedback to
subordinates, you will gain credibility and respect in their eyes. For complex,
large projects, set intermediate deadlines for authority.

## What types of cases can be delegated

When concentration at the operational level is prolonged, degradation is
inevitable. Therefore, simple and routine tasks should be delegated to
lower-ranking subordinates. The time of a powerful manager or company owner is
more valuable than the time of an ordinary employee. It must be managed
competently and rationally.

Knowing the characteristics of organizational levels of responsibility will help
in giving the right assignments to subordinates.

| The first one | Employee gathers information on his own. Suggests solutions.                                                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Second        | The employee shall make his own decision with the mandatory approval of his supervisor.                                    |
| Third         | The subordinate does everything himself. The supervisor only observes the work process.                                    |
| Fourth        | The employee presents and tells the supervisor the result of the work. The supervisor gives advice and evaluates the work. |
| Fifth         | The contractor deals with the problem on his own, with no response from above.                                             |

Subordinates can and should be assigned tasks:

- Preparatory work on the project, including information gathering, analysis of
  competitive advantages. Creation of a base for calling potential clients.

- Easy things to do. As an example, filling out an online store catalog or
  entering invoices into the accounting system. All tasks with checklists or
  instructions should be delegated.

- Repeat business (publishing social media posts, mailings).

- One-off tasks that do not affect the functioning of the company (organization
  of a corporate event).

Key parts of the business that are more complex than a routine task, important
processes, risky projects, strategic or administrative tasks cannot be
delegated.

## LeaderTask - an effective tool for setting tasks

Delegation of authority in management cannot be called a simple process. In
order to properly delegate tasks to subordinates, a manager must make decisions
quickly. To take responsibility for the actions of a whole team of employees. A
competent manager is able to clearly create assignments to performers and
distribute them. Controls their execution at every stage. Timely makes the
necessary adjustments to the task, composite tasks according to the plan and
importance. Corrects errors arising during the work on the task. Gives a
professional assessment of the performer's performance.

## Conclusion

A good manager is a teacher who is patient with the mistakes of his subordinates
and genuinely rejoices in their successes. Do not overdo it with supervision. If
you constantly "stand behind the performer", he will not be able to concentrate
on the work and perform the task well, so it is important to have a good
relationship with your employees.

To delegate successfully, you need to teach your subordinates to have a positive
attitude and to do the job correctly. This will make it easier to develop
detailed instructions. They should describe technologies, factors, and work
algorithms. The performer should clearly understand what he is doing, why and
for what purpose, follow these and instructions in the course of work on the
task and when making decisions. Then he will successfully cope with the assigned
task, and you will have time for important and strategic matters.
