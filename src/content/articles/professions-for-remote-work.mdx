The pandemic that dramatically changed the way of life of many people on the
planet is fortunately a thing of the past. Most offices have quite quickly
returned to the usual offline mode, but the popularity of remote work has not
diminished at all, and has even increased. Many professionals, having
appreciated the benefits of the remote format, have decided not to return to the
office space. Last year alone, their number increased by 79%. Companies also
quickly adapted to the new conditions. A large number of vacancies for remote
workers have appeared on the labor market, not only in IT, but also in other
industries. A recent trend has been the expansion of the geography of hiring and
the attraction of personnel from other regions. The labor legislation even has
relevant norms regulating remote activities.

The remote method of working has many pluses, such as:

- Savings on transportation and food.

- Absence of a "toxic" environment.

- Convenient schedule.

- Collaboration with well-known companies.

- More time to spend with family.

For all the many advantages, remote work is not suitable for everyone. Its
disadvantages:

- Lack of socialization. No modern technology can replace live human
  interaction.

- Difficulties in career advancement. Most often, remote specialists are
  entrusted with tasks at a specific stage of a project. They are rarely
  involved in the company's global business processes.

- Lack of a full workspace. It is difficult for relatives to realize that,
  sitting at a computer or laptop at home, you are doing serious work, not just
  clicking on the keyboard. Therefore, you will be distracted for every possible
  reason.

- The problem of self-monitoring. The remote format implies complete
  independence. Therefore, it is suitable for disciplined and responsible people
  who are able to separate work and household chores.

If the above disadvantages outweigh the advantages you will get from remote
work, feel free to try this format, especially since this trend continues to
actively develop in the world and in our country.

Today we will tell you about the top of the most in-demand and well-paid
professions in remote work, which will suit experienced professionals and
