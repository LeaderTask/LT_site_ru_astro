Trying to keep up with the busy rhythm of modern life, we often try to
accomplish a lot of things in a short time. But, often all these efforts do not
give the desired result. Why this happens and what to do about it, explains the
Pareto law, which is also called the 80/20 rule.

## Formulation and operation of Pareto's law

![Pareto's law](/80-20-rule-1024x594.webp)

According to history, the world economy owes the discovery of the law to a
talented Italian author, sociologist and economist Vilfredo Pareto. While
working in his vegetable garden, the scientist observed pea plantings and
noticed that only 20% of planted plants produce the bulk of filled pods. The
rest of the specimens produce low quality fruits that do not yield. The law
later became famous and was further refined by Joseph Juran, an American
researching in quality management, who proved that this rule works effectively
in other areas of life as well. For example:

- In the economy. 20% of working people provide for 80% of retirees.

- In commerce. 80% of the profits of trade enterprises come from 20% of
  customers. 80% of sales come from 20% of products.

- In finance. A 20% investment yields 80% of the return.

- Household. 80% of the clothes a person wears account for 20% of their entire
  closet.

- Traffic situations. 20% of drivers are responsible for 80% of accidents.

- In employee productivity in enterprises. 80% of the work will correspond to
  1/5 of the working hours. 80% of a company's income is generated by only 1/5
  of its employees.

The law applies to work, personal life, science and the economy in general. The
80/20 rule is used to determine the importance of the resources under study and
to select priority areas for development. Sometimes these figures change,
depending on external circumstances. But, the essence remains the same: most of
the results are achieved under the influence of fewer causes.

### Principles of the 80 by 20 pattern

The essence of unequal distribution of efforts and resources is realized through
the following techniques:

- It is enough to put in a small amount of effort to achieve the intended goal.

- Most of the actions we take in an attempt to implement plans are ineffective.

- The seemingly logical and understandable things and behaviors are not always
  right.

- Most failures are due to a minimal percentage of unfavorable factors.

- To achieve 80% success, 20% effort is enough. To strive for 100% success is
  foolish and irrational, as it will take 100% effort.

This pattern can be seen even in relationships between children and adults. Here
is a simple example from life: parents want their son to become a musician and
put him in a music school. Studying takes a lot of time and effort, most of
which is made up of persuasion and conviction in its expediency. The child
forcefully agrees to his parents' conditions, but studies "after a while" in
order to get away from it. As a result, the child cannot achieve the desired
result.

## How effectively the principle works in business and life

![principle pareto in business](/zakon-pareto.webp)

The theory of the Pareto Principle 20 by 80 clearly demonstrates how effort
affects results. It is applied in business and in ordinary life. It is used when
selecting priority areas in activities that require more attention and more
careful consideration. Using this approach, you can get rid of unnecessary links
in the chain of work processes and unproductive employees who do not benefit the
company.

Based on this idea, it is worth deciphering and assuming the hidden factors
present in any case. Because of them, it is not always possible to achieve the
intended goal. Here is another example: a firm sewing women's clothing has
released feminine and beautiful dresses. But, for some reason, the demand for
them is not great. It turns out that the girls who like them, can not afford
such styles because of the peculiarities of the figure. And those to whom such
outfits will fit, are interested in other models.

If statistical data is analyzed incorrectly, there will be inconsistency and the
truth will be distorted. Therefore, it is important to focus only on reliable
information in decision making. To determine the 20% of services and goods that
will bring profit to the company, it is necessary to perform classification of
goods and statistical analysis of past sales.

### Application in economics

In the economic sphere, the Pareto efficiency explanation is a state in which
the performance of a system cannot be improved without worsening other
performance. The ideas are applied in various spheres of business. Their use
helps:

- Increase profits and sales in the company;

- Improve staff performance;

- Rationalize the investment in advertising.

The approach works most effectively in management, logistics and marketing.

### How to conduct a Pareto audience analysis

In marketing, pareto is used to calculate and, as a consequence, analyze the
target audience of online stores. Given that 80% of profits bring 20% of
customers, determine the preferences of the main customers. For this purpose, a
questionnaire is developed, the content of which contains questions that allow
you to learn more about the tastes and interests of users:

- Who are they? (Specify age, gender, place of residence, interests).

- What do people buy at the store? (Main and related products).

- How much is spent on average per visit?

- How did you hear about the store?

Based on the information obtained, optimization is carried out, focus on content
and channels that attract loyal customers. They are expanded, promoted and
optimized. It is not worth wasting time on an audience that makes purchases from
time to time in small quantities.

### Assortment analysis

In the course of Pareto analysis of the assortment, a significant 20% of the
items that generate most of the company's profit are identified. They are
presented using automated accounting programs or analytical systems. Additional
information for analysis is obtained from the following sources:

- social platforms;

- ratings of teaser and banner networks;

- advertising monitoring and viewing services;

- keyword analyzers.

Based on the obtained data, the goods that are in the greatest demand among
consumers are selected. They are additionally promoted through advertising
channels and the assortment is expanded. Other items for balance should also be
present, but in smaller quantities.

### Application of the 80/20 principle in human resources management

![80/20 principle in human resources management](/8020.webp)

Pareto's law states that only 1/5 of workers in companies are productive. The
other 4/5 are just "passing the time" at work. The implication is that even in
such conditions, the efforts of "progressive specialists" are enough to make the
company profitable and efficient.

Does it mean that if you fire 4/5 unproductive employees and hire other
professionals in their place, that all of them will work with 100% efficiency?
Not at all. Because, according to psychology, any team is inherently passive.
That is, the same 20% will remain productive.

To increase the productivity and efficiency of a company's employees without
experiencing an imbalance, you need to:

- Use a quality incentive system;

- introduce time management principles into the company's organizational
  structure;

- timely get rid of "ballast" (employees with a negative attitude to work who
  are not interested in keeping their jobs).

It is possible to make the right decisions in personnel management only after
negotiating with everyone and after thoroughly studying the characteristics of
employees. Diligent and diligent employees should be singled out, rewarded and
given certain preferences. A fair step would be to dismiss the lazy ones and
motivate and train the rest of the team.

### Where a Pareto chart is used

In time statistics, a Pareto chart is often used to identify the most
significant factors affecting the performance of a process. The diagram shows
the problems in descending order or frequency of occurrence. This method of
analysis consists of and applies to the following situations:

- When there is a need to systematize an increased amount of data;

- To communicate to stakeholders the problems that exist in the company;

- To structure tasks by importance and prioritize them;

- To clarify the relative importance of the data.

The Pareto chart formula is considered along with the benefit-cost analysis.
Sometimes the way to eliminate several factors affecting 30% of the problems is
more economically feasible than removing a single factor affecting 50% of the
problems. In this case, the decision is made based on the economic benefit
without considering the place the factor should be in.

## How to properly use Pareto's law to improve performance

Using Pareto principles, you can improve your personal productivity and learn
how to highlight the most important things that will bring more results among a
huge number of daily tasks. Pay attention to your office colleagues: they spend
most of their time on reflection. Distracted by various extraneous matters,
social networks, empty conversations, in the end they do not have time to devote
to their direct duties. Therefore, they have no time for anything.

In order to get the best results from your work with the least amount of effort,
you need to be able to identify the main tasks in the work process. You should
spend most of your energy on them. The little things should be put on a distant
shelf and work on the rest.

In practice, it looks like this:

- Make broad monthly, weekly and daily to-do lists. Determine which of them are
  more important and prioritize them. It is convenient to do this with the help
  of special programs for time planning.

- After calculating the time and energy spent on each task, give them scores on
  a 10-point scale.

- To find the average between two types of costs add their estimates to each
  other and divide by 2.

- Also evaluate current and future performance by giving a score from 1 to 10.
  Based on the data obtained, calculate the average performance.

- Calculate the efficiency of each task by dividing the performance by the
  average cost.

By categorizing the to-do's by efficiency, you can select the more important
to-do's. The higher this indicator is, the higher priority is given to this
task. It is better to abandon unimportant tasks by delegating them to others or
completely refusing to perform them.

## Benefits of using the LeaderTask application in time management

Organizing personal and work time management has become much easier with the
advent of special programs that help you create schedules, create descriptions,
and monitor the execution of plans. These include LeaderTask, which supports all
modern time management techniques, including:

- GTD;

- AutoFocus;

- Pomodoro;

- Do It Tomorrow;

- Final Version;

- and others.

LeaderTask will successfully replace the traditional life diary, planner and
many other tools used in management. The program is suitable for the following
purposes:

- Making to-do lists for the year, month, week or day.

- Combining them into common to-do lists, categorizing them using color
  selections or labels.

- Project Management.

- Implementing time management principles into the company's operations.

The app functions on all types of platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows,
macOS and Apple Watch.

## Results

It is hard to disagree with the fact that the Pareto principle has an impact on
all areas of life. If you know and use its rules correctly, you can achieve
impressive results. Having identified priority areas, it is worth directing
maximum efforts to them. It is better to fully complete one important task than
to "almost finish" several minor ones.

We tried to briefly analyze this topic and tell you more about the Pareto
principle. Guided by the pareto law, you can increase productivity, make the
business more profitable, get rid of unnecessary workload and develop an
effective marketing policy for the company. But, at the same time, it is worth
taking into account the various associated factors, because of which the method
will not work properly.

To make your life and work processes harmonious and organized, it is convenient
to use special digital applications for time management. They will help you
prioritize your tasks, remind you when they are due, and prevent you from
missing any important events, freeing up time for personal business and leisure.
