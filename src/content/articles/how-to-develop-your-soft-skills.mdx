Until recently, the main document for a job seeker when applying for a job was
an educational diploma corresponding to the position for which he or she was
being employed. But today, most employers do not only focus on the professional
experience and skills of their future employees. They are interested in the
personal characteristics of applicants or soft skills. They directly influence
the employee's prospects in the company, showing how he or she solves production
tasks, communicates with other people, and makes decisions.

## What it is

![What is Soft Skills](/chto-take-soft-skills-1024x682-1.webp)

Applicants for vacant positions are usually interviewed several times during the
hiring process. At the first meetings, general questions unrelated to the main
duties are asked. Often the applicant is asked to tell a free-form story about
himself or herself. This is how soft skills are assessed. What is it in simple
words? This term comes from the English language and literally translates as
"flexible or soft skills". That is, character traits, individual features of a
person, not directly related to the profession, but important for future work.
For example, communication skills, the ability to interact with other people or
stress resistance.

The popularity of teamwork dictates its own conditions on the labor market.
Employers are interested in attracting responsible, active specialists who are
able to negotiate with partners, argue their position, and work effectively in a
team. Flexible skills simplify the work with information, help to feel confident
in their professional sphere, make life full and interesting.

Soft skills are equally important for a sales manager, designer, marketer or
project manager. They need to be developed by teachers, freelancers, and
researchers. Flexible skills are useful in all fields. They are formed in
childhood and are directly related to emotional intelligence. And this is
confirmed by various sociological studies. For example, scientists from Harvard,
Stanford and the Carnegie Foundation have proved that developed soft skills
determine 85% of a person's success in a profession, while hard skills, such as
professional experience and technical knowledge, only 15%.

This trend is related to the development of modern technologies. Due to their
constant modernization, academic knowledge quickly loses its relevance.
Therefore, a company is interested in hiring an employee who learns quickly,
adapts easily to various situations, finds non-standard solutions, and does not
pass over difficult situations. His past academic achievements are of no
particular importance.

Ideally, soft and hard skills should complement each other. This makes it
possible to easily and quickly solve any tasks, including quite complex ones.
For example, a graphic designer, in addition to hard skills, such as mastery of
Figma, Sketch, and Adobe Photoshop tools, will need empathy, communication, and
creative thinking.

## What are the benefits of developed soft skills

![benefits soft skills](/benefits-soft-skills-1024x682-1.webp)

Flexible skills help in all areas of life. They are necessary for communication
with relatives, friends, teachers, colleagues. They influence the ability to
adapt to different situations (for example, when moving to a new place of
residence), to find contact with strangers, to cope with difficulties more
easily and to be ready for changes.

They are also useful:

- When looking for a job. Any company seeks to get a non-conflict specialist who
  is able to find a common language with other people, positively influencing
  the immediate environment.

- In the process of labor activity. In any company, employees have to constantly
  communicate with their superiors, colleagues, clients and business partners.
  Therefore, regardless of their position, experience, and specifics of work, it
  is important to correctly communicate their position to others, argue it, and
  be able to negotiate.

Developed soft skills provide the following advantages in life and business:

- Increase the level of professionalism;

- Improve personal productivity;

- Ensure time management;

- Help you work effectively in a team of any size;

- Provide a climb up the career ladder;

- Optimize workflows;

- Reduce stress levels.

## Types and groups of soft skills

![Types soft skills](/types-soft-skills.webp)

Globally, soft skills fall into several major groups:

| Communicative                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Social                                                                                                                                                                                    | Self-organization                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Managerial                                                                                              | Research                                                                                              |

To become a sought-after specialist in any industry in the short term, it pays
to develop the following skills:

#### Communication

This skill is necessary to establish contacts, to fulfill professional and life
tasks. It consists in the exchange of information, experience, knowledge. It
includes:

- Business communication (this includes correspondence with work colleagues,
  clients or management, and the ability to negotiate to achieve certain goals);

- Public speaking (the ability to express oneself clearly and competently).

To develop these skills, it is important to communicate a lot. And not for
nothing, but for a specific purpose: to negotiate, negotiate with suppliers or
customers, give presentations or lectures, participate in discussions and
business games.

#### Critical thinking

It is a balanced approach to the processing and consumption of any information.
Being in a continuous flow of information, it is difficult to understand where
in it is the truth and where is a lie. As a result, the risk of becoming a
victim of someone else's manipulations increases. Therefore, it is important to
learn to critically evaluate information coming from outside, to be convinced of
its reliability, to look for cause-and-effect relationships and draw the right
conclusions. For this purpose, it is necessary to develop observation and logic.

#### Customer focus

That is, identifying the needs of your audience in order to meet them quickly.
For example, delivery of an order to the customer's address. Your customer will
save time and feel cared for. And you will get a loyal client who will turn to
you more than once. This will help to compete more effectively in the market of
goods and services. Systematic analysis of the target audience will help to
develop it.

#### Project Management

In essence, any endeavor a person undertakes is a project. Whether you are
building a house, going to university, or going on vacation, you are undertaking
a project. It also involves other people: clients, helpers, family members, or
government agencies. The person managing the project holds all the levers of
this complex system. It is up to him or her to decide what the project will be
and what the outcome will be.

To develop the skill, it is important to learn self-organization. Consider each
task as a project, designating in it the goal, deadlines, and stages of
fulfillment. You should also strive to optimize your projects. If, for example,
you are often late for work, prepare to leave in advance or think of a shorter
route taking into account traffic jams.

#### Mentoring

When getting a job after training, many professionals face problems due to lack
of practical knowledge. In reality, they are required to have completely
different skills from those they received at university. A tutor or mentor can
help them adapt to new conditions and become competitive in the labor market. He
or she draws up a training plan and monitors the results. He or she adjusts
training depending on progress. If you become a mentor, you will be able to
share your knowledge and professional skills with other team members and help
the team adapt to new tasks or projects.

To develop your mentoring skills, develop a development plan for yourself. Think
about what knowledge needs to be replenished and "pumped up". Track the results,
mark your progress. Having mastered the art of managing your own learning
processes, you can offer your colleagues to become their personal mentors. In
this way you will help them and sharpen your skill.

#### Non-violent communication

This method is based on clearly conveying information to the interlocutor in
order to get something in return. You tell him some fact, tell him what you
need, formulating a request. This way you will get what you need from a person
without hurting him. Learn to identify and stop violent communication in a
timely manner.

The skill is necessary for negotiations, collective discussions, communication
with relatives and colleagues. The main thing is to be persuasive, not to overdo
delicacy and softness, as this will lead to loss of authority and a feeling of
distrust towards you in the interlocutor.

To develop this ability, you should try to understand the people around you,
treat them with empathy. Regular attendance of specialized trainings will help
to form this skill.

#### Decision-making

That is, the ability to choose the best option from those offered. Thanks to
this skill, you will achieve your goals at a lower cost, quickly, promptly,
without hesitation. For example, you are offered two good jobs at the same time.
If you take a long time to decide on the choice - you can miss both. Therefore,
you need to make an informed and well-considered decision quickly.

You can develop this ability by developing farsightedness: the ability to see
the maximum number of options. Prioritize your goals, cases, tasks, choosing the
best of the possible. In case of difficulties at work, address the manager not
with a problem, but with a specific variant of its solution.

#### Working with problems

In difficult situations, you can complain about life to those around you or take
appropriate action to resolve them. Once you have developed the skill, you will
easily cope with any problems in life or at work. To do this, formulate your
main problems, coming up with two or three dozen solutions for each of them. Set
deadlines for which they need to deal with them. If during this time you can not
cope with the problem, think of new options for its solution. Remember: there
are no problems that cannot be solved.

#### Emotional intelligence

This is the ability to read people's emotions, moods, and motivations with the
ability to control them. With the help of this skill you will find it easier to
communicate, to find mutual understanding with other people. For example, if
during your presentation you notice that listeners feel bored, tired, you can
take a break.

To develop this ability, you need empathy for yourself and others. Pay attention
to your own and other people's emotions, understand what events they are
associated with. Control yourself, base your decisions on your observations.

#### Learnability

That is, the ability and desire to learn new information, using it in future
life to solve everyday tasks. Knowledge is transformed into skills, and those,
in turn, into skills. When learning, it is important not to be limited to
theory, but to use the information obtained in practice.

To become a learner and develop the ability to manage knowledge, create a
personalized learning plan for yourself by choosing areas that will be useful to
you in real life. Live, try out concepts and theories. For example, implement
time management techniques and tools and put them into practice.

#### Working under uncertainty

The modern world is described by the acronym VUCA, which stands for the
following:

- V - volatility;

- U – uncertainty;

- C – complexity;

- A – ambiguity.

In such conditions one has to be adaptive, flexible to changes, and competently
manage available resources. This skill is associated with the technique of
stress management - managing oneself or other people under intense stress,
limited time or force majeure.

To develop this ability, you need autonomy. You need to look for non-standard
ways out of situations, try new tools and approaches, do not be afraid to change
the usual format of work and communication, follow trends and choose what suits
you best.

### Other examples of soft skills

- Lean-technique or lean manufacturing, which is the ability to identify and
  eliminate any waste by improving the processes of creating tangible or
  intangible things. By managing your workload correctly, you can prevent
  burnout at work by getting more done in less time.

- Ecological thinking is an ability related to responsibility for one's actions
  and a positive worldview. When you do what you love, you experience joy and
  pleasure, and you are not afraid of problems. Their occurrence does not make
  you panic, but encourages you to make the right decisions.

- Self-analysis of deeds, behavior, actions is necessary for their evaluation
  and correct choice of further direction. Knowing yourself, you will behave
  consciously, make rational and balanced decisions.

   appropriate level.
