Behind every success is a well-coordinated and competently organized team
activity. Almost all the existing benefits of modern civilization are the result
of collective work. In any activity a person has to interact with other people.
Therefore, everyone needs to learn the skills of teamwork as early as possible.
Let's try to understand what this concept includes, and what skills you need to
possess to become a good "team player".

## What teamwork is all about

![What is teamwork](/komandnaya-rabota-1024x683.webp)

First of all, let's formulate a definition. Teamwork is a coordinated, organized
joint activity of people. They pursue common goals and share responsibility for
the achieved result. But not every group of people working together can be
called a team. Employees of one company sitting in the same office, even working
on a joint project, are not always a team.

The term was originally used in sports to refer to a group of athletes united by
a common goal, each acting in a common interest. Example: a basketball or
volleyball team whose members have a common goal, act together within a
developed strategy, but each has a different area of responsibility.

Nowadays this concept is actively used in the business environment. A team is
commonly referred to as a small group of people (from three to twelve
participants) bound by common interests, goals and commitments.

Let's try to give a description of teamwork through the main attributes:

- Overall Objective.

- Striving for continuous improvement in productivity.

- Mutual Responsibility.

- Complementary skills.

- Small number of participants.

Team members depend on each other. Therefore, the results of each of them
influence the overall success. The interests of an individual in such a team are
secondary. Common tasks and achievements come first. Each member of the group
knows how to competently use his knowledge, skills and experience, shares them
with his comrades, cares about the welfare of others. Together they act as a
whole. Such joint activity gives an effect that is many times greater than the
resources and efforts spent on achieving the goal. Teamwork is always based on
synergy and equality.

## Distinctive characteristics of the team

![characteristics of the team](/otlichitelnye-harakteristiki-komandy-1024x585-1.webp)

Each team has its own characteristic traits:

- Common goals that unite its members. They are clear and valuable for each
  member of the group. As they are achieved, the group sets new goals for
  itself.

- Motivation is one of the most important aspects of teamwork. All team members
  act consciously and are interested in achieving the common goal as soon as
  possible. They sincerely want to successfully complete all assigned tasks and
  actively work for the result. Joint achievements of the team are the main
  value of its members.

- Long-term collaboration. The team is not assembled to do one-off work. It
  always has plans and goals for the future.

- Limited number of participants. A team cannot consist of one person or include
  a large number of people. Studies have shown that the best performance is
  demonstrated by teams of 3 to 10 people. Organizing and coordinating large
  teams requires additional funds and resources.

- Role allocation. As in sports, each team member strives to achieve common
  goals, acting within his own competence. All team members are assigned a
  separate role. Someone organizes meetings, someone communicates with clients,
  analyzes the information received.

- Absence of hierarchy. A team is a structured, organized collective in which
  there are no leaders and subordinates. All its members are equal among
  themselves.

- Collegial decision-making. This is done by organizing joint meetings and
  discussions where all participants take turns speaking so that everyone can
  express their ideas and suggestions.

- Autonomy. The team solves any work issues independently.

Every executive or manager knows that it is impossible to assemble a good team
overnight. It has to go through certain steps along the way:

- The first stage is the adaptation of the team. People exchange information,
  test each other's capabilities and abilities. This stage is characterized by
  low efficiency due to mutual wariness and mistrust.

- In the second phase, small interest groups are formed in the team. In this
  phase, disagreements are possible because of mismatched goals or motivations
  for teamwork.

- The third stage is cooperation. Team members realize the importance of a
  common task. They have a desire to solve it together. At this stage, the
  pronoun "we" appears for the first time in the formulations and ways of
  solving tasks.

- The fourth phase is associated with the development of norms, rules and
  principles of teamwork. Interpersonal communication moves to a qualitatively
  new level. A sense of trust and empathy towards colleagues emerges.

- The fifth stage of team building is functioning. At this stage, balanced and
  constructive solutions to problems are made. Roles are distributed among the
  participants. A real team appears, with common goals, each member of which
  contributes to their achievement, putting public interests above personal
  ones.

## Pros and cons of teamwork

![Pros and cons of teamwork](/plusy-i-minusy-komandnoy-raboty-1024x682-1.webp)

Organized teamwork and teamwork helps you find common ground with others,
interact effectively with others, use your strengths wisely, and respect your
colleagues. Top key benefits of teamwork:

1. Solving complex tasks that one person cannot cope with. At its core, teamwork
   involves accelerating processes and improving quality by building a cohesive
   team. By joining forces, employees can show excellent results that far exceed
   their individual achievements.

2. Positive impact on self-esteem. By contributing to the common cause,
   participants realize their value and usefulness to the team.

3. Development of the skill of communicating with others, the ability to
   constructively and adequately perceive criticism, to discuss, to convey one's
   point of view to others.

4. Fostering a sense of respect for the labor of others, the formation of
   analytical thinking.

5. Career development. Teamwork has a positive impact on the career of
   individual employees. Working in a team allows for the development of
   cooperation skills, improves communication and facilitates the exchange of
   experience among participants.

Teamwork skills are among the top ten most in-demand characteristics in 2023
according to LinkedIn. All top global companies strive to build strong,
organized teams. Here are a few more reasons why teamwork is important for
success:

- In the process of teamwork, innovations are born, mistakes are promptly
  detected and optimal ways of solving any problems are selected. Such results
  are achieved thanks to the psychological safety of employees. They listen to
  the advice of colleagues and are free to express their own opinions.

- A good team saves the company resources required to hire and train new
  employees. People value their jobs, want to stay where they are valued,
  respected, listened to and paid adequate salaries for real merit.

- Joint teamwork helps you make bold and prompt decisions. Feeling the support
  of colleagues makes it easier to make difficult, sometimes risky choices. But
  it is the big risks that often bring serious profits.

The results of team activities are always higher than when performing similar
tasks alone. Joint work in a team helps to realize large-scale and complex
projects.

Consider the disadvantages of teamwork:

- Any team needs extra time to get acclimated. It takes weeks, and in some cases
  even months, to build a cohesive team.

- The speed of teamwork is slower than individual work, especially when the
  number of participants is large. For example, it is not always possible to get
  everyone together at a specified place at a specified time.

- Discussions and arguments also take up a certain amount of work time, although
  they are beneficial to the work process. If you think you are right on an
  issue, it is not certain that you will be able to convince others.

- Decisions on any issue require majority agreement. Because of this, they may
  be delayed and delayed.

There are activities for which teamwork is inappropriate. For example,
monotonous routine labor or individual sports.

## What skills are needed to work in a team

![What skills are needed work in a team](/kakie-navyki-neobhodimy-dlya-komandnoy-raboty-1024x682-1.webp)

A friendly, well-functioning and cohesive team is the dream of every manager.
But it takes time and effort to get a well-functioning, efficient team at your
disposal. Moreover, for successful interaction with each other, team members
must possess certain characteristics and skills. They are formulated on the
basis of the Big Five five-factor personality model, which describes five traits
of human character: openness, conscientiousness, benevolence, extraversion and
neuroticism. Skills needed in teamwork:

- Reliability. One of the most valuable qualities of any specialist is the
  ability to keep his promises. He is always on time for meetings and delivers
  work on time. To sharpen and develop this skill, it is important to learn to
  manage time: make plans, fix them in a notebook or app, and track the
  execution. A constantly late, disorganized, deadline-busting employee is a
  "weak link" in any team. He destabilizes the discipline in the team and slows
  down the work. Therefore, it is necessary to "put him in his place" or get rid
  of such "ballast" in good time.

- Ability to listen, restraint in conversation. It is very difficult to keep
  yourself in control and patiently listen to other people without interrupting.
  But this skill gives a lot of advantages. First, the respect and sympathy of
  colleagues. Secondly, valuable information that may be useful in future work.
  And, thirdly, you learn to control any conversation, to direct it in the right
  direction.

- "Keeping to yourself" bad moods and negative emotions. They should not be
  carried into the team. The bad mood of even one employee has a detrimental
  effect on the entire team. This is one of the negative factors that should be
  avoided when working together.

- Enthusiasm. By treating their work with sincerity and love, team members
  encourage each other and energize others with optimism.

## How roles are assigned in the team

All team members are equal in rights, but it is important to realize that their
roles are different. They hide the functionality of each performer. For example,
motivators (working with organizational and material resources), implementers
(executors) and pedants (controllers) are responsible for actions. Interaction
within the team is organized by coordinators (leaders), resource researchers
(diplomats) and team players (the soul of the team). Generators (theorists),
strategic analysts (gray cardinals) and experts are in charge of generating
ideas. They are the consulting arm of the team. When assigning roles, it is
worth taking into account not only professional skills, but also the personality
types of employees.

Team building by organizing training and various corporate events - is used to
improve teamwork efficiency. Team building shows excellent results - it helps to
strengthen team cohesion. Joint games and sports activities help to strengthen
team spirit, and group trainings allow to develop soft skills and improve
relationships within the team. Management should take the most responsible
approach to the preparation of such events and take into account all the wishes
of employees and the specifics of the team in order to unite the participants
and build a truly successful team.

In addition to team building, there are many specialized practices that improve
teamwork. For example:

- **Scrum** is a project management methodology based on iterative and
  incremental development.

- **Agile methodologies** are a set of methodologies based on an agile approach
  to project management and product development.

- **Kanban** is a process management method that helps to visualize processes
  and track all the steps of work.

Each of these methods allows the team to do the work faster and better, reduce
costs and improve product quality. It is very easy to master them, you just need
to know the basic principles.

assign specific tasks to each performer or an entire team. Then you control the
deadlines and progress of their fulfillment. Each task card has a built-in chat,
where you can discuss any questions and project details. The manager can add
priority tags ("Important", "Urgent"), checklists, and any files to it.

You can follow the progress in the "Calendar" or "Schedule" tabs, where all
tasks and tasks of an employee for the current day or week are displayed.
Analyze the performance of past actions in the "Task History". Using the special
"God Mode", the manager can see and control the tasks of all his subordinates.

connection.

## Conclusion

So, what is the most important thing in teamwork? To follow the rules of the
team, to treat its members with respect and attention, to strive for
development, to be enthusiastic and optimistic about your work and to energize
others with this energy. A manager who wants to create a good team should set
realistic, achievable, clearly defined goals for his subordinates. Each
performer should have his own role with specific responsibilities and tasks. The
team needs a clear plan to ensure transparency of actions. It is also important
to monitor the size of the team (up to 10 people is optimal) and the
psychological environment in the team.
