The efficiency of a company at any stage of management depends on the quality,
efficiency and diligence of its employees. This is achieved only by those firms
in which managers know how to give tasks in such a way that they are executed
perfectly.

But not every manager knows how to correctly distribute tasks. In most cases,
subordinates either perform tasks on automatic, or misinterpret the questions
asked, or are lazy and shoddy in dealing with problems.

So how do you give out assignments competently, so that there are no comments on
the end result, and the work is done perfectly? There are several principles
that should be known to every manager who is striving for business growth. We
will talk about how to set tasks correctly in this article.

## What is a mission statement

The key competence of a manager is to correctly define the functions, company
goals and tasks for the business for a specific period of time, and then - to
indicate the best ways of their fulfillment by subordinates with a clear
algorithm of actions.

The exact formulation of the problem situation, description of sequential
activities and the image of the result that should be obtained and presented by
employees as a result of labor activity - this is the process of setting tasks
in business.

If a manager lacks this skill, staff may misinterpret tasks, causing them to
misconstrue requirements and undermine workflow.

## Why do you need to set goals?

An impeccable problem-setting is half of a successfully completed task, which
includes a good half of problem solving. It organizes the team, multiplies the
work effect of each individual participant in the work activity.

Whereas chaotic efforts without a clear formulation are always unpredictable.
The result is either short-term, poor quality, or negligible impact. Moreover,
the disparate actions of a group of people without a common plan under the
supervision of management can cause irreparable damage to business activities.

## Types of tasks

When developing and setting current tasks, the manager should take into account
their status, urgency and importance. In the workflow, it is customary to
distinguish four types of input tasks. Let us examine them in more detail.

### Important long-term

These are global tasks of paramount importance for business development. For
example, to become one of the top ten online stores in the segment, to raise
revenue to ten million a month, to open ten branches across the country, to
develop new IT technology.

These tasks are planned carefully, developed not one day, not handed out at
planning meetings and meetings. Setting such goals requires a special
atmosphere, a certain composition of participants (programming specialists,
developers, top managers, marketing director, etc.).

### Important current

They require immediate solutions for the subsequent successful development and
organization of the business. For example, changing suppliers, breaking a
contract with one courier service and entering into an agreement with another,
choosing a new partner. Need prior preparation and planning.

### Everyday

These are basic tasks that must be performed by employees on a daily basis for
the company to be fully operational. These issues are usually handled on the
fly, without any preparation or planning. For example, calls and mailings to
customers, ordering goods.

### Other

Provide for tasks that do not need urgent fulfillment. The company's success and
achievements do not depend on their realization. For example, buying a new
coffee machine for the office, holding a corporate party, moving the
administrative building to a new building.

## Tasking rules

Effective goal setting has nothing to do with a rudimentary checklist or to-do
list. It consists of several components, which often include:

- competent distribution of roles in the work team, taking into account the
  skills and abilities of all subordinates, prompt execution of tasks;

- Appointing those responsible for the success of the campaign;

- Concretization of the team's actions with the indication of strategy, goals
  for the near future, a set of certain activities;

- detailing the end result for staff motivation;

- time limitation of execution with the assignment of approximate deadlines for
  the full completion of the assignment;

- use of tracking tools and means to monitor the progress of work and all the
  nuances of the labor process (software of various capacities, for example,
  CRM-systems, schedulers, etc.).

When assigning tasks to subordinates, it is also important to follow several
important communication rules. These include the following:

1. Specificity. Specifying intermediate and final results, using quality
   standards, criteria and characteristics of the finished work.

2. Contextualization. Communicating to subordinates the importance of this task
   for the business as a whole.

3. Respect for the staff, politeness. Conveying a positive attitude towards
   employees, belief in their capabilities through tone, words, gestures, facial
   expressions.

4. Trust. Lack of rigid control.

5. Openness. The ability to answer a subordinate's question at any time about
   the task he is performing.

6. Constructive feedback. Criticism should only be relevant, clear and
   well-founded, and contain working advice.

7. Appreciation for the completed work with step-by-step analysis of the
   activity.

If these rules are followed, tasking employees will be effective and execution
will maximize output.

## Mistakes made by executives

A number of blunders and omissions made by the manager when setting tasks can
lead to missed deadlines, inaccurate execution of assignments or ignoring of the
task by the staff. Let's highlight five main points that managers often do not
pay attention to. And very in vain, because they greatly affect productivity and
labor efficiency.

### Assurance that the subordinate has guessed what the supervisor meant

A clear and detailed instruction is a prerequisite for the perfect execution of
an assignment. Explaining the fine details of complex tasks takes only a few
minutes, but it prevents possible conflicts, mistakes and miscalculations of
personnel in the future.

### Vague deadline

The time frame for creating a new product or service, fulfilling a technical
assignment, etc. should be clearly defined. The words "quickly", "soon",
"urgently" are interpreted in different ways. As a result, employees may be
convinced that they have several days to complete a task, whereas you originally
meant a couple of hours.

### Lack of examples

Examples bring clarity to the matter, help to form a clearer idea of what you
want to get out of it. They are most necessary if employees have not yet
performed these tasks or have not experienced assignments of this specification
in practice.

### Lack of alternatives

Sometimes a task may be impossible due to various circumstances and reasons.
Then it is a good idea to immediately outline alternative options for
accomplishing the task. This will allow the employee to do his work calmly,
without bothering the manager about trifles. At the same time, there is a
significant saving of time.

### Disinterest in how well the employee understood the task

An important condition for setting tasks is to realize that the staff
understands the task and has an idea of the final result. Therefore, a competent
manager is obliged to find out if the team still has questions for him. But
there is also an important nuance here: many team members are embarrassed to ask
questions or clarify points and topics they do not understand.

In order to avoid this situation, it is recommended that the manager, after
setting the task, ask his subordinates open-ended questions such as: "Where will
you find information to complete the task?", "What additional tools will you
need to complete the task?", "What methods and techniques will you use?", "Will
you need the help of programmers or other specialists before the project is
completed?", "What will you need to learn during the work?".

In this case, the manager has the opportunity to personally ensure that each
team member understands the direction they need to work in and the steps they
need to take to successfully complete the case.

There are also a number of taboos that should never be tolerated. For example,
you must not formulate assignments in an aggressive or dictatorial tone, ask
several people to perform the same task, refuse to admit mistakes, ignore a job
well done and leave it without moral or financial reward.

## Use of CRM systems

Modern CRM platforms are a convenient and easy way to keep all assigned tasks
and information about them in one place. With the help of these programs, it is
possible to formulate and distribute assignments in real time and monitor the
progress of execution.

Popular services collect scientific and mathematical analytics, help identify
successful managers and identify unproductive employees who delay deadlines and
fail to complete tasks.

## Conclusion

So, how to achieve success in setting tasks for subordinates and maximize
business efficiency in their execution by employees? It's simple. Carefully
formulate the details of each task, set deadlines, communicate respectfully with
staff and assign responsibility. Don't forget that tasks should be clear,
transparent and easy to understand.

create tension in the team. Organize your work with the help of special tools,
CRM-system and trackers. In this case, tasks will be completed on time, work
