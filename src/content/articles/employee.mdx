This practical course was created specially for employees.

Spend 20 minutes on this course. It will help you to study out the program and
make the first step for effective work.

The course saves dozens of hours. If you skip the course and start working in
the program, it is inevitable that questions like "How it works? What for is
this button?" and so on arise. This means that you have to divert you attention
away from work and search for answers in FAQ or contact the tech support. As a
result you waste your precious working hours.

So just try not to divert yourself away next 20 minutes.

Let's go!

## Step 1

Read all your tasks for today

![employee](/employee1-1.webp)

Go to the "Today" section (under the Navigator). If a chief assigns you tasks
for today find them there.

Take a look in the program no less than once an hour to be able to react to new
tasks.

Double click on a task. Read a broad description of an assigned task.

If you know how to perform the task — press "Write down a message" write down
"Accepted" and press Enter. This message is a signal for your chief. Now the
chief knows that you are ready to perform the task.

## Step 2

Start performing the task

Tasks should be performed on by one from up to down.

Since you start performing the task select the status "In progress". Right click
on the task — Status.

## Step 3

If you have a question when performing the task — write it in the "Discussion".

![employee](/employee4.webp)

Any questions should be discussed in LeaderTask. Use the "Discussion". If you
discussed anything with your manager just in words and didn't write down the
main information just in few hours you can recall just a part of information or
even nothing.

If you think you can't complete the task to the deadline write it down in the
"Discussion".

## Step 4

Read the answer of your manager as soon as you find the name of the task bold.

If you see the task marked bold it means that something changed in it.

Enter the task and read the answer of the manager.

Write down all intermediate results in the Discussion.

## Step 5

Since you completed the task select the status "Ready"

Then the task is crossed.

Pass over to the next task.

You can hide completed tasks. Right click on the upper panel — untick "Show
completed tasks".

## Step 6

Correct remarks of the chief if the task comes back with the status "Needs
correction".

![](/employee9.webp)

If the task comes back with the status "Needs correction" this means that the
manager didn't accept the results.

Go to the "Discussion" and read the comment of your manager.

![employee](/employee9.webp)

Correct remarks of the manager.

Then set the status "Ready" to the task.

The manager checks the results of the task again. If there are no questions the
manager select the status "Completed".

## Step 7

Watch the short video about how to create the to-do list:

Watch 2 short videos (no more than 2 minutes each one) of how to do this:

Most important:

- Save everything in LeaderTask. Don't keep in your mind any task even
  unimportant.

- Tasks created right now can be seen only by you.

- You can bind a task to a day or several days (for a complex task) but also you
  can leave without a date (drag it in the Inbox or in a project).

Step 8

Find tasks which should be performed at a certain time, then drag them to the
daily planner

There is a prototype of the dayplanner in LeaderTask. It helps you to organize
tasks by the time bar. There you can change the task performance period, drag
them at another time and make review of your tasks for several days.

Most important:

- If a task has a certain time of perfomance this time is shown in the task
  field (in the to-do list)

- You can change the order of tasks in the list but the order in the dayplanner
  doesn't change. And vica versa.
