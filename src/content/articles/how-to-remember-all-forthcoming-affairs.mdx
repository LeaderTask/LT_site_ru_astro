Did you have such situations when you forgot about some business? You remembered
about it all week, represented how you will execute this business, and then
time, and at the most inappropriate moment it escaped from attention.

My colleague got into such situation on the eve of the important action. It was
necessary to be prepared for an event: to send till Friday a suit to a
dry-cleaner. He recalled this task every day. And in the environment he
overworked and forgot. He recalled only on Friday when was already late.

That such troubles did not occur, it is necessary to write all affairs in the
scheduler, and then to distribute them on days. Further everything is simple: in
the morning you open the to-do list for today, and your attention will lose
nothing!
