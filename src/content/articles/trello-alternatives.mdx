desktop versions. There is a way to keep an eye on the job that your staff is
doing, and regular users may manage all of their affairs, both at work and at
home. An alert system that prevents you from forgetting anything crucial, the
capacity to carry out the largest projects, communication on a job with an
employee or client, and many other helpful features were brought by LeaderTask
and were highly required by the creators themselves. The application of every
time management system now in use by LeaderTask is another unique feature.
Certain ones, like the Pomodoro technique developed by Francisco Cirillo, are in
the form of extra instruments.

![LeaderTask is a To-Do List and Your Task Management App](/desktop_preview_home_video2.webp)

With LeaderTask, you may work on an infinite number of distinct projects and
assign staff members to separate tasks that don't conflict with one another.
Even a situation where freelancers may view the jobs that a company opens for
them was considered by the developers. It's also crucial to remember that
LeaderTask's database is designed to withstand heavy loads, so it can handle
enormous amounts of work without sacrificing performance.

The cost of the platform's premium subscription is $3.33, and the Business plan
is $4.66.

## 2\. Asana

Asana is a leading project management tool that has migrated to Kanban over the
past few years. Asana has comparable capabilities to Trello when it comes to its
board approach to task management. It also includes more advanced workflow
automation features and three different views. Particular recognition should go
to the application's fully complete mobile version, which lets you accomplish
everything you can do on a PC. There are many options for each task: you can
create subtasks (checklists), add files, write feedback, use hashtags to notify
interested parties of changes quickly, use tags for more precise filtering,
finish a task with a single click, quickly change the deadline by getting
permission from the manager, and more. Additionally, there is a Unified Inbox
feed similar to the social network where you can view all task-related activity
and I can see all recent changes.

The free plan includes up to 15 users, while the premium plan starts at $10.99
per user per month. The Advice view or tab offers almost the same user interface

task owners, as well as those with complicated projects, will find Asana to be
excellent. Furthermore, Asana comes with over 100 built-in connectors, including

interface by default is more akin to a more robust version of the program. But

straightforward. By selecting the + symbol in each column, you can quickly add
additional projects and reposition the cards to fit your requirements.

In Basecamp, work is done in a single area where teams, projects, and company

task sheet, papers, and files, a general discussion, a calendar, and automated
