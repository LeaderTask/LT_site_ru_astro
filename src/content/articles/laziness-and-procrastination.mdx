Do you postpone solving an important task, prefer rest to work, even urgent
work? Such situations are familiar to everyone, but what is their cause? Some
call the lack of motivation and unwillingness to do something laziness, others
procrastination. At the same time, there is a huge difference between the two
definitions. In the article we will tell you what is the difference between
laziness and procrastination, so that you are no longer confused about the
terms, understand what is happening to you. After all, having understood the
essence of the phenomena, having identified the cause of the problem, it is
easier to cope with it.

Laziness and procrastination are psychological terms that have different
mechanisms of formation. To understand the essence of the phenomena, let us give
a detailed definition of each concept.

## Where does laziness come from?

![laziness](/laziness.webp)

Laziness (Latin lenus - "calm, slow") is defined as a passive unwillingness to
perform a certain task, to work. In this state, you refuse to work, prefer to
rest, to conserve energy. The individual has no remorse, the stress level is
normal. A person calmly postpones the solution of issues for tomorrow, and this
happens regularly. For example, you watch a fascinating TV series all day long,
knowing that you need to clean the apartment, but you do not worry about what is
happening, but enjoy your vacation.

The most common causes of laziness are lack of motivation, lack of understanding
of the importance of the task, overwork. Apathy, unwillingness to work are often
caused by problems with mental or physical health: disorders in the functioning
of the endocrine and nervous system, vitamin deficiency, depressive states.

The French psychologist Alfred Binet at the end of the 19th century identified
two main types of laziness. Congenital is a feature of personality associated
with weakness, indecisiveness, apathy. Temporary laziness is an incoming
condition caused by circumstances. The subject may have a fear of defeat, lack
of understanding of how to begin to perform the task, confidence in their
abilities. The above description fits the psychological definition of
procrastination.

## What is procrastination?

![What is procrastination](/procrastination-full-time.webp)

The term first appeared in scientific articles in 1977. The origin of the
definition is connected with the Latin word procrastinatio meaning
"procrastination", derived from the lexeme crastinum "tomorrow" and the prefix
pro "for the sake of".

The difference between procrastination and laziness is that the subject has
reasons to postpone work. He understands that the behavior is ineffective, will
lead to unpleasant consequences, feels discomfort, but he starts doing
extraneous things. Even if the procrastinator tries to distract himself, watch a
movie or go for a walk, he is unlikely to be able to relax, because he will feel
the pressure of the unresolved problem.

Yes, laziness and procrastination have the main similarity: work is not done.
Only the causes of psychological phenomena are different. So why does
procrastination appear? Postponing things can be a defense mechanism that helps
us avoid stress. For example, we are afraid to fail, so we delay the moment.
Someone can't get started on a job they've been assigned. Sometimes the reason
is inadequate assessment of the complexity and urgency of the task, inability to
manage time properly.

To understand in more detail why we postpone activities, let's name the signs of
different types of procrastinators highlighted by psychologists:

1. Anxious. A type with a high degree of anxiety, trying not to leave the
   comfort zone. Procrastinator is afraid of change, so he tries to avoid doing
   things that disturb the usual order of things.

2. Perfectionist. Strives for perfection, rarely achievable in real life. The
   perfectionist believes that if something cannot be done perfectly, it is
   better to deal with other issues. Procrastination here is the easiest way to
   avoid the frustration of not achieving perfection.

3. A dreamer. He believes that everything in the world is easy and simple. There
   are more such procrastinators after attending marathons teaching that money
   comes by itself, dreams come true without effort. And then the subject stops
   working. Why, if everything will come by itself? Only in life everything
   works differently.

4. Crisis-maker. He needs thrills, so he needs to wait until the last moment,
   only then to start working. Unlike the previous type, the procrastinator does
   not think that everything is easy, on the contrary, he needs stress to
   fulfill his commitments.

5. Pleasing. Takes on cases in order to impress others, to make them feel good.
   Since the tasks are not always interesting to him, he will delay their
   solution until the last minute or will refuse to fulfill his obligations at
   all.

6. Disobedient. Does not like to be commanded, wants to solve his own tasks, not
   those given by another. Through postponement, a disobedient person protests
   against coercion.

## How do you beat laziness and procrastination

Psychology offers several ways to cope with procrastination. Let's name the most
effective methods of combating procrastination:

- If you are frightened by the amount of work, divide it into several stages.
  This will help you get closer to the solution of the task, structure it, and
  make it more understandable.

- To properly estimate the time it takes to complete a large amount of work,
  make a to-do list, write down how many hours you need to complete each task.

- Notice when you start to procrastinate. Track the moment, try to confront it
  at the very beginning. Get to work right away before procrastination
  completely takes over you.

- Put away things that distract you from your goals. Turn off your phone, log
  off social media. If it's hard for you not to be distracted at all, give
  yourself half an hour to work and 5 minutes to rest. A routine will help you
  not to get tired and get your work done on time.

- To keep laziness and procrastination at bay, give yourself a reward for every
  task you accomplish. Have a juice, surf the internet for a while, go for a
  walk. A change of activity is the best rest, plus you'll feel like you're not
  just exhausting yourself with work, but making time for a relaxing pastime.
  The right approach will reduce stress and make work more enjoyable.

- If you are engaged in a socially important task, think about how much good
  your labor will do, praise yourself for taking on such things.

- If you can't start working because of fear, try to figure out what it is you
  are afraid of. Play the most unpleasant scenarios in your head, this will help
  you realize that things are not really as serious as they seem.

If procrastination is due to waiting for the right mood or an inability to plan,
an effective task manager, LeaderTask, can help defeat the unpleasant condition.

## Conclusion

The difference between procrastination and laziness is in the causes and
feelings. In the first case, a person prefers rest instead of work, saves
energy, does not consider the task necessary to fulfill. In this case, laziness
does not make him feel bad, feel guilty or ashamed. In procrastination, the
feeling is different. A person realizes the importance of the task, but for some
reason postpones its solution. At the same time, he takes responsibility for his
behavior, so he may feel guilt, stress, and other unpleasant feelings.

According to psychologists, there are only 20% of chronic procrastinators, the
rest become such in different situations. But constant procrastination can
become a habit, leading to slower career growth, lack of life achievements, and
increased stress levels. Therefore, procrastination should be fought in order to
become successful, motivated, and achieve your goals. The LeaderTask app will
help you fight procrastination.
