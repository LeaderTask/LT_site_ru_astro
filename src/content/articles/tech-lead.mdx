Each development team includes a technical leader or tech lead, who is
responsible for the quality of technical work on the project. He knows what
technologies to use and how to apply them correctly to achieve the desired
result.

This role is usually assigned to the most experienced member of the team. He has
expert knowledge in development and technical expertise, can think big and
strategically, and is not afraid to take responsibility for the technical work
of the team. This is an intelligent, educated person with an engineering
background who has achieved informal leadership in the team due to his
initiative and extensive experience in development, helping to make competent
and rational decisions on the project.

## What does a tech lead do on a team

![What does a tech-lead do](/chto-delaet-tech-lead-1024x683.webp)

The activity of this performer largely depends on the specifics of the company,
the complexity of the project and the nature of the tasks to be performed within
it. The technical manager or techlead raises the level of technical excellence
of the team, creates suitable conditions for the introduction of new
technologies and integrates them into work processes.

A technical lead in IT is a specialist responsible for code quality, building
architecture, developing manuals on how code should be written. This role can be
formal or nominal, depending on the team or project. In classic Scrum, it is not
emphasized. But in most large teams that function according to Scrum
methodology, the tech lead performs many useful and important tasks for the
project. The main one: providing the team with all the necessary technical means
for successful project realization.

Regardless of the scope of work, the duties of a tech lead also include:

- Selecting technologies for specific tasks or projects. Compiling a list of
  software, programs and equipment needed by team members for productive work
  with regular monitoring and updating of information.

- Direct responsibility for implementing new solutions in the development,
  testing of software products.

- Build processes including CI/CD, code review, implementation, engineering
  technology development.

- Prevention of risks arising from technical imperfections in the product.

- Planning, strategizing the functional development of the product.

- Training and development of engineering skills of team members.

- Solving technically complex problems that cannot be handled by other team
  members.

Since a technical leader is not an official position, but a role in the team, it
is usually assumed by the most proactive and experienced employee. In software
development, programmers become technical leaders, while in the QA area these
functions are assigned to testers. Most of the time they are engaged in general
tasks, switching to separate tasks when necessary.

Techlead focuses not only on the technical solution itself. He helps the team to
make the right and appropriate decisions that are correct from a technological
point of view. "Not to create a software product on your own, but to help the
team do the job with less time and resources, without bugs and errors." A good
technical leader increases the productivity and efficiency of the team. The
speed of development and testing increases, the software product contains fewer
bugs and errors, so it needs less revision.

If no one on the team takes responsibility for the quality of the code and the
final product, it is unlikely that it will be viable in the market. This
threatens the business with downtime, loss of client data and other problems.
Conversely, a competent, technically sound solution can save millions.

## How is a TechLead different from a TeamLead?

![What is the difference between a techlead and a teamlead](/team-lead-vs-tech-lead-1024x682.webp)

Technical leaders are often confused with team leaders. But these roles on a
project have a significant difference. Techleaders deal with technological
developments and processes. Teamleaders are managers who manage the activities
of developers, building communication between all project participants.
Sometimes these two roles are performed by one person, combining the duties of a
team leader and its technical manager. But there is one caveat: while a
competent teamleader can become a good technical leader, a specialist in
technology and technical processes does not always manage people effectively.

Each company has its own unique experience and its own idea of what each
performer does within a project or team. Let's look at the division of
responsibilities of a tech lead and a team lead in more detail using the example
of a development team:

1. The project manager approves the list of tasks for the project and passes
   them to the teamleader.

2. The teamleader clarifies the details of the task, checks the correctness and
   accuracy of the requirements, and completes its description. Then the task is
   sent to the technical lead.

3. The technical supervisor checks the accuracy of the task and, if necessary,
   breaks it down step by step. Identifies performers and assigns tasks to them.

4. When the development is completed, the task is returned to the technical lead
   for code-review. He accepts it or sends it to the executor for revision with
   a corresponding comment.

That is, in this project, the tech lead is responsible for the technical quality
of the product, and the team lead is responsible for meeting deadlines and
budgets. The obvious advantages of this profession are the opportunity for
professional and personal growth, and decent financial remuneration. But a team
leader also bears high responsibility. He guarantees the quality of work
processes in the team. Any technical error can lead to failures in the work.
Therefore, he must constantly learn, develop and update his knowledge, master
new technological processes.

## Essential qualities and skills

We've already talked about the greater importance of "hard professional skills"
or Hard-skills for a technical leader:

- He should be fluent in development languages and have sufficient programming
  experience.

- Have an understanding of project architecture, principles, tools and patterns
  of its construction.

- Possess the ability to scale systems and be able to organize architectural
  reviews.

- Understand testing processes and tools including optimization, metrics and
  monitoring.

- Have experience in incident management.

The following qualities will be needed for successful task management for a
techlead applicant:

- Developed communication skills to communicate with candidates to the team.

- Ability to set realistic goals.

- Strategic thinking, ability to envision results.

- Empathy towards others, a sense of empathy for others, the ability to listen
  and hear others.

- Ability to clearly communicate goals and objectives to the team.

- Leadership, the ability to persuade and lead people.

- Developed erudition, knowledge in different fields.

- A keen interest in technical innovations and trends in their field.

The Tech Lead does not have to be directly involved in the development. But he
plays the role of a mentor in the team, a "play coach" to whom each participant
can turn for help and support. If a Tech Lead refuses to do "manual work", he
loses credibility in the eyes of his group and degrades as a specialist. While
teaching others, he must learn himself. To show by personal example which
technologies and practices are better to choose in each specific case.

The technical leader should be familiar with project management tools and tools,
work with code versions, CI/CD and DevOps tools. Create scripts and own code
development.

A Techlead is not a silent performer. He shows initiative and offers new
technical solutions to the team and the company. Self-discipline and
self-organization are important for this specialist. At least showing initiative
and activity, it is impossible to achieve positive results without proper
distribution of one's resources.

## Does a team always need a tech lead

The need to assign the role of technical lead is dictated by the specifics of
the team's activities and the nature of its tasks. A specialist of this level is
required for large-scale projects involving the creation of complex technical
products.

Working in development without those leads will sooner or later lead to a
decline in business processes. Even if the team works smoothly and in an
organized manner, its members will not have time to keep up with new
technologies and methods of working on projects. A technical leader will quickly
react to changes and help his team to keep up with the times.

A Techlead is essential when launching a new product. He describes the
technological characteristics, customizes the main parameters, monitors risks,
is responsible for bugs, and commits to delivering a technically perfect product
that will fully satisfy the customer. This is why large companies may have
several technical leaders. The main thing is that they should effectively
interact with each other, share personal experience and find mutual
understanding among themselves to move the company towards success.

## Team management with LeaderTask

![LeaderTask](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

Currently, there are quite a few automated systems and services for effective
team management within a project. One of such tools is a functional and modern
team management program LeaderTask. Thanks to the flexible settings of the
service, you can quickly distribute tasks between performers. Monitor the
quality and deadlines of tasks. Set reminders about upcoming events or
deadlines. Communicate with other team members in chat.

The application has a built-in role assignment system that allows you to manage
any team competently. Each team member works with tasks from their area of
responsibility, focusing on important and prioritized tasks. You can track
project tasks on a calendar or use a kanban board to visualize workflows. Create
projects, team up with others for teamwork. Share ideas and store all important
files and project information in one secure place, not tied to a digital device.

In the application you can monitor the performance of each employee on a
detailed graph. You can work with the program in the office or remotely,
including without an internet connection.

## Conclusion

A Techlead is the most experienced, erudite, and proactive software engineer on
the team. Any developer who is interested in technologies and ready to dive in
and understand them can apply for this role. He should competently manage his
knowledge and interact with the team, acting as a "mentor", "mentor", ready to
help in solving the most complicated and incomprehensible tasks.

More and more serious IT companies are interested in attracting competent
technical leaders. For this role, they offer impressive financial rewards,
sometimes several times the salary of an ordinary developer. Usually, ambitious
developers with 6 to 10 years of experience become technical leaders.

If you are ready to master this specialty, be ready to always learn and develop,
develop your self-organization and planning skills, use modern tools for working
with projects, learn to think strategically and systematically. Find the courage
to take responsibility for implementing new solutions and team actions. And be
sure to "tighten up" your education. A Techlead can benefit from expert
knowledge in math, physics, computer science and other exact disciplines.
