You can't stop time. But you can learn to manage it. Staff productivity depends
on how rationally this resource is used in the company. Corporate time
management helps to organize teamwork so as to get the best results with less
effort. It is a set of tools and methods for effective distribution of working
time.

## Importance of time management in company

It is possible to be a true professional, to plan every action, to have
excellent self-control and the ability to organize your day. But, at the same
time, you suffer from the disorganization of your subordinates, who spend most
of their time on extraneous matters. This complicates the fulfillment of tasks
and extends their deadlines.

In any company, there are rules. For example, in the area of financial
management. They require clear compliance by all employees. Example: after
arriving from a business trip, an advance report is prepared in the same form
for all employees. It must be filled out and submitted to the accounting
department to account for expenses.

Time is money. Therefore, this valuable resource must be handled accordingly.
These issues are solved by team time management, the main objectives of which
are:

- proper tasking of employees;

- management of work processes in the company;

- calculating the time to complete various tasks.

The implementation of a corporate time management system allows:

- improve the performance of the company's employees;

- to achieve the optimal economic effect with less resources;

- get your priorities straight;

- Effectively accomplish tasks within designated time frames.

## Principles of corporate time management

The corporate time management system is based on the observance of clear rules
for the use of working time. They are based on the following principles:

- The concept of purposefulness based on the correctness of task formulation. In
  order to perform tasks effectively, you need to clearly understand their
  purpose. Understand what the end result will be.

- Planning. This is one of the main elements of time management. By prioritizing
  tasks, workers will spend less time on non-essential tasks. This will help
  them focus on key processes and complete them faster.

- Priority designations. Derived from the previous principle. When drawing up an
  action plan, it is important to prioritize the most important tasks and
  distribute them in descending order. At the end of the list should be the most
  unimportant task that has no direct impact on the result of the work.

- Self-discipline. This is the main quality of an organized and helpful
  employee. Each team member should strive to accomplish the tasks assigned to
  him without being distracted by extraneous matters.

- Qualities of rest. Any labor requires rest. Without it, overload is
  inevitable, leading to a decrease in work efficiency. In order not to work to
  exhaustion, you need to separate the time of work and rest. Spend free time
  with comfort and benefit.

- Documenting objectives. This process is necessary to capture the objectives in
  writing. If the goal is written down, it means it is real.

- Dividing tasks into stages. Extensive projects are broken down into individual
  tasks, which are carried out in a specific sequence.

- Planning hierarchy. Project activities are forecasted based on the time
  available. That is, the plan is made for a day, a week, a month, a year, etc.

You can use your working time more efficiently and rationally by eliminating
chronophages or "time eaters". These include all factors that distract from the
main work. For example, gadgets used for watching TV shows, socializing with
acquaintances or playing games during the working day.

To use your time effectively, you need to focus on the main task at hand. If you
spend your energy on several different tasks at the same time, you will have to
constantly switch from one task to another. This will lead to absent-mindedness,
loss of attention and further prolong their completion.

Corporate time management utilizes other tools to help plan work. These include
the following techniques:

- "Elephant". It implies division of voluminous tasks into separate stages. It
  is used to organize complex, multi-stage processes.

- "Eat the frog". It consists in making a to-do list, from which the most
  difficult to implement and unpleasant tasks are selected. It is with them that
  the performer starts his working day.

- "Swiss cheese". It also involves creating a list of tasks, but they are
  started, on the contrary, with the simplest ones. According to the creator of
  the method, psychologist James Reason, it allows you to do any work faster.

- "Tomato". Requires mandatory division of labor and rest time. For example,
  after working every 25 minutes, the employee must take a five-minute break.
  After four such approaches - a break for 30 minutes. But, in order to achieve
  efficiency, it is important that the established time limits are limited.

Various tools are used within the corporate time management system for rational
organization of employees' working time. These include paper organizers and
special electronic applications and services for task planning. With their help,
it is possible to distribute tasks among subordinates, make a schedule of tasks
