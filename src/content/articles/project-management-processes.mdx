Any work process consists of projects, the aim of which is to create an
exclusive service or product. Each project has a structure, including a
beginning and an end, when the set goals are achieved or it becomes clear that
the task cannot be completed. To achieve these goals, specific efforts are made,
which come together in project management processes. These encompass active
actions related to development and the creation of a specific product or
service.

## **What Project Management Processes Represent**

All projects pursue one or a series of goals that are achieved through various
means. They are constrained by material and human resources, as well as time
frames. Project management is the use of knowledge, professional experience, and
skills to achieve the set goal. This term is often confused with another similar
term: 'activity.' However, activity involves moving towards a set goal, while
'management' involves direct intervention in the processes within that activity.

**A simple example to explain the difference between these concepts:**

'You are driving a car on the road from your city to the neighboring one. To
achieve the result, you need to take certain actions. This is activity. When you
saw a pothole on the road, you maneuvered around it. You continue driving,
slightly changing direction. This is management, as you actively influenced the
process. You see a sign that the road is closed due to repairs. You need to make
a decision again: turn back or find another route. This is also process
management.'

In other words, management is active intervention in project processes. If a
manager does not directly influence processes, it means they are not managing
them.

## **Project Management Processes How Project Management Process Groups Work**

**The processes within a project are divided into groups:**

- Project Management: This includes organizational work related to the project,
  along with their descriptions.

- Product-Oriented: These depend on the field of project implementation and
  involve creating a specific product.

These process groups interact continuously. Some happen simultaneously, while
others follow each other sequentially. Without knowing how a product is created,
setting correct goals is impossible.

Key Characteristics of a Project:

- Uniqueness. It is carried out here and now.

- Focus on the end result. The uniqueness of the product obtained.

- 'Triple constraint' of material resources, content, and time.

Individual process groups constitute the project's life cycle. These include:

- **Initiation.** At this stage, preparatory work for the project is conducted,
  beginning with the development of an idea and making a decision to start
  project execution. A project charter is developed, and participants for the
  future process are determined.

- **Planning.** Tasks are set, goals are determined. Key milestones to be
  achieved at each stage are calculated. Possible external and internal factors
  that impact the project's progress are identified. It is important at this
  stage to engage all participants in discussions to develop practical and
  effective schemes.

- **Execution.** Implementation of specific actions within the established plan.
  All project-related tasks are distributed among executors or groups of
  executors.

- **Analysis.** Comparison of achieved results with planned ones. Decisions are
  made regarding potential action adjustments.

- **Control.** Development and implementation of an accounting and deviation
  forecasting system within the project's scope. Compilation of cost estimates,
  work schedules. Regular tracking of incoming information for timely
  decision-making.

- **Completion.** Results of completed work are delivered to the customer or
  consumer. During this phase, necessary documentation is compiled, and
  agreements are reached with customers, government bodies, or other
  stakeholders. Identified deficiencies are addressed, and if necessary,
  improvements are made. A final settlement for the completed work is conducted.

- **Warranty Obligations.** The contractor provides a guarantee for the work
  performed, committing to rectify identified deficiencies at no cost, if they
  arose due to their fault.

To understand the essence of project management processes, let's examine the
interactions of these tools and methods in more detail.

## Interaction of Process Groups in a Project

Every project starts with an idea. In this phase, there is a single subprocess -
authorization or the decision to move on to the next stage. This stage is
planning - one of the significant parts of the project, consisting of 24
additional subprocesses, including:

- Quality plan development (with setting standards and ways to achieve them,
  resource-efficient utilization, and high profitability).

- Organization planning (with the distribution of functions among participants,
  assigning responsibilities for reporting, and performing specific tasks).

- Staff assignment (selecting employees for various project tasks).

- Interaction planning (determining methods of information exchange,
  communication options between participants).

- Preliminary risk assessment (identifying and documenting external or internal
  factors that can have a direct or indirect impact on the project's progress).

- Risk assessment (detailed clarification and summarization of risks, their
  impact on the project).

- Risk response (actions aimed at preventing potential risks).

- Supply planning (approving frequency, schedules, assortment of products, or
  other resources required to fulfill project conditions).

- Conditions preparation (with written documentation of delivery deadlines,
  supplier selection).

The result of completing the planning phase is the creation of a structured
project management plan. This interactive document can be supplemented at any
stage.

Execution and control processes involve implementing the developed plan. During
project execution, it's important to regularly monitor and analyze interim
results for timely corrections. The following auxiliary technologies are used
for management at this level:

- Execution tracking. Involves preparing and distributing information with the
  required frequency.

- Quality confirmation. Regular checks are conducted during project work to
  ensure the quality of performed tasks aligns with established standards.

- Proposal development. Gathering feedback, requests, and suggestions from
  project participants.

- Supplier engagement. Selection of suppliers and contractors for tasks planned
  within the project.

- Contract control. Evaluation of how project participants (contractors,
  suppliers, other stakeholders) fulfilled their obligations as per signed
  contracts.

- Team development. Training is conducted to enhance professional skills and
  improve the team's competency.

The main task of the execution and control phase is to manage and coordinate
project activities. It involves documenting requirements and making necessary
changes while ensuring that the process stays within the approved budget.

The analysis processes encompass the study of planned indicators, the degree and
level of their fulfillment. The key processes of this stage are actions related
to the project's objectives and indicators that characterize its success and
effectiveness. These include:

- Schedule analysis, determining how actual work completion times align with
  projected ones.

- Cost analysis of work. It clarifies whether the project cost corresponds to
  the planned budget and its profitability.

- Quality analysis. Results are compared against approved quality standards.

- Confirmation of established objectives. Acceptance of project results by
  clients or consumers.

The analysis stage encompasses:

- Performance assessment (analyzing achieved outcomes and providing information
  to stakeholders).

- Resource analysis (evaluating whether actual resource usage matches planned
  indicators).

The management processes involve a set of actions that actively influence the
course of project implementation. If the project proceeds without deviations,
this phase involves communicating tasks to project participants and monitoring
their execution. If issues arise during work, changes and adjustments must be
made in a timely manner. The management phase includes:

- General management (actions aimed at adjusting and making changes across the
  entire project).

- Resource management (changes related to resource reallocation within the
  project).

- Objective management (adjusting goals based on analysis of ongoing project
  activities).

- Quality management (identifying causes of defects and implementing measures to
  address shortcomings).

Ancillary processes in the project management phase include:

- Risk management (responding to events and making adjustments).

- Contract management (working with subcontractors and contractors, resolving
  conflicts that arise during project work).

Concluding processes involve administratively finalizing contracts and signing
appropriate documentation. If the client approves the delivered outcome and
signs accompanying documents, the project can be considered fully implemented
and completed.

The essence of project management lies in applying methods and technologies to
execute the aforementioned processes. All of these are applicable across various
industries, such as construction, information technology, manufacturing, and
others.

LeaderTask: An Application for Organizing and Controlling Project Management

There are no identical projects, just as there are no universal methods for
their implementation. Therefore, managing them is necessary using appropriate
tools: automated programs that visually display all the working processes
occurring within the 'body of the project.'

One such application is LeaderTask – a comprehensive interactive system for
managing processes in companies of any size. The planner is convenient for
scheduling, assigning tasks to individual employees or structural departments,
and allows real-time tracking of staff performance.

By using LeaderTask for project management, it becomes easier to monitor
deadline compliance and gather reports on the completion of specific project
stages. All necessary data will be within one system, which can be used in
offline mode as well, without an internet connection.

The LeaderTask program integrates with GTD, Autofocus, Superfocus, Pomodoro
Technique, Do It Tomorrow, and other services. It operates on various platforms
including Windows, MacOS, iOS, or Android. It offers a free trial period.

## **Conclusion**

Regardless of the number of team members or project complexity, effective
management requires a clear understanding of the desired outcome and timeline.
Without this clarity, influencing processes becomes challenging. To achieve this
understanding, crafting an action plan is essential.

Initiating project work entails starting with goal formulation and result
description. Define the scope of work. Create a list of roles and allocate them
among team members. Appoint responsible individuals. Set deadlines for
reporting. Progress should be managed with regular oversight of all project
stages, enabling timely adjustments as needed. Results and actions should be
documented and agreed upon with the client to prevent disputes during project
acceptance.

Challenges may arise during project execution:

1. **From the Client's Perspective (This is not what I wanted)**: This situation
   arises due to a lack of mutual understanding between parties at the project's
   initial stages. The client didn't provide a clear outline of their needs, and
   the executor didn't clarify the desired outcome. Incorrectly formulated
   project goals and tasks led to improper execution. This underscores the
   importance of written agreements between parties.

2. **From the Executor's Perspective (We've done much more than required)**:
   Preventing this situation involves clarifying the roles and functions of each
   project participant. It's advisable to allocate a budget with a 10-15% buffer
   for potential revisions.

**Financial and Accounting Aspects**

Vital to internal analysis of a company's financial activities is proper
accounting. Competent accounting practices facilitate harmonious relations with
partners, governmental bodies, and credit organizations. By using
management-oriented software aligned with the company's chosen methodology,
success can be achieved in executing projects of any nature and complexity.
