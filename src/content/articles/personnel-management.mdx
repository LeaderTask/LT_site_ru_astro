Competent personnel policy is a priority in the development of any company. It
affects the productivity and efficiency of employees. When choosing ways of
influencing subordinates, HR services are oriented on general and specific
principles of personnel management.

## The Essence of Human Resource Management

Human resource management is the organised and continuous influence on
employees. Influence on them with the help of various tools and methods,
corresponding to the strategy and policy of the company. The management system
includes tactical and strategic part, external and internal environment.

**Tactical human resource management is focused on the following tasks:**

- Recruitment, training, retraining, and education of employees;

- career progression and dismissal;

- individualised staff performance appraisal;

- analysing, planning the number of employees.

**The strategic subsystem of personnel management deals with:**

- development, analysis of the company's personnel structure;

- by creating a human resources policy for the enterprise;

- monitoring the efficiency of employee time utilisation.

The external environment of the personnel management system includes departments
of production management, sales, supply, and finance of the company. The
internal part is the personnel management mechanism itself, which fulfils the
functions:

- recruitment of personnel and organisation of labour relations in the team;

- development, professional development of employees, organisation of favourable
  working conditions at workplaces;

- staff motivation;

- information, legal management based planning, human resources marketing.

The productivity of employees largely depends on the actions of the human
resources department. Personnel are the most difficult resource to manage.
Collectives consisting of individual personalities react differently to the
impact of management. It is difficult to predict the reaction of each employee
to a particular management decision.

Modern management concepts recognise the importance of each employee's
personality. They are oriented not only on profit, but also on the satisfaction
of social and material needs of subordinates. They are guided by general and
private principles of personnel management, consisting of rules that require
mandatory fulfilment.

## Principles of personnel management

The basic principles of personnel management are universal. They are applicable
in any company. They are mandatory for implementation. They include:

- **Management focus**. It implies a clear setting of goals within the
  organisation and its structural units. The main goal is determined on the
  basis of the company's mission. Related goals should be complex, but
  achievable, have a correct formulation. This will help to mobilise the efforts
  of the personnel to achieve them, make their work transparent and
  understandable. The goals should correspond to the resources available to the
  company. At the same time, it is important to identify and eliminate at an
  early stage the weak link that may hinder the realisation of the set goals.

- **Systemic**. According to this principle, any company is a single system,
  uniting all employees interacting with each other and the environment.

- **Division of labour**. It is based on the division of management levels,
  specialisation of workers. Each level solves its own tasks. At production
  enterprises, foremen do not fulfil the tasks of the director, and the director
  does not concern himself with issues within the competence of foremen. Each
  employee performs work in accordance with his or her functional
  responsibilities.

- **Equal opportunities for all participants in the work process**. This
  principle should be adhered to, starting with the selection of personnel.
  People are not divided by gender, age, nationality, appearance or other
  qualities. Only their professional qualities and their ability to adapt to the
  team matter.

- **Responsibility**. It is based on the introduction of a system of rewards and
  punishments for unfulfilled tasks. Penalties are chosen according to the level
  of the employee's authority. The higher the position - the more
  responsibility. The manager should not just give assignments to subordinates,
  but have the authority to do so.

- **Competence**. The manager should be well versed in the field of activity of
  the company he/she manages. This principle works in conjunction with
  horizontal co-operation associated with the delegation of authority to lower
  level managers.

- **Discipline**. The most important principle of personnel management that
  should be present in any company. It is the strict fulfilment of job duties,
  management orders or requirements of policy documentation. Strict discipline
  in the work team has a positive impact on the culture of personnel management.
  At the same time, control over compliance with job duties should not prevent
  employees from realising their creative potential.

- **Motivation**. Motivation of employees by means of material, moral resources.
  The employee should be economically interested in labour results, receive
  psychological and emotional satisfaction from his activity. This can be
  achieved by competently using the levers of influence on the staff. One of the
  indispensable elements of the incentive principle is also fair treatment of
  employees.

- **Hierarchically**. It represents a vertical division of labour, in which the
  lower links are subordinate to the higher ones. This principle is used when
  building the management structure of an organisation.

- **Subordination to common interests**. Each member of the work team
  contributes to the development of the company. As a result, the company's
  profitability increases, and employees receive the promised remuneration and
  other material and spiritual benefits.

All the above rules are related to each other. It is possible to achieve
effective functioning of the personnel management system only when they are used
together.

## Private management principles

Modern personnel management is centred on the private principles of personnel
management. These include:

- Attention to people, their initiative and needs.

- Delegating responsibilities to employees, joint decision-making, involvement
  in the social life of the team.

- Абсолютное доверие между руководством и работниками.

- Team building, creation of a unified team in which each participant takes
  responsibility for the results of his/her labour.

- Improving methods of rewarding and incentivising employees.

The selection of specialists for the company is based on the individual
abilities, education, and personal characteristics of the applicants. The
selection of candidates also takes into account their professional skills and
experience. Invited employees should have the necessary skills and abilities to
fulfil the general tasks of the company and be able to work in a team.

At the same time, the interests of management and employees must not contradict
each other. For this purpose, regular monitoring is carried out to determine how
satisfied employees are with their jobs and working conditions, and what they
think about the company's further development.

## Methods and tools for personnel management

It is worth distinguishing between principles and methods of personnel
management. The former require constant and strict application. They are norms,
rules that should be observed when forming and managing a company's HR system.
Methods are a more flexible category, representing a set of tools that help to
achieve the set goals.

**They differ:**

- in terms of content;

- method of exposure;

- directionality of influence;

- have an organisational form.

**Based on the nature of impact, personnel management methods are:**

- Organisational and administrative. They are based on maintaining discipline in
  the company, instilling in employees a sense of duty and responsibility for
  their work. All regulations issued by the company's management are enforced on
  a mandatory basis.

- Economic. Based on financial incentives or sanctions against employees.

- Social and psychological. They imply moral influence on the company's
  personnel, creation of a favourable environment within the team.

Let us consider the peculiarities of application of these tools and mechanisms
in more detail.

### **Administrative**

They have a direct impact. They are based on maintaining a sense of duty,
responsibility among employees, compliance with discipline and working hours.
They are divided into the following types:

- **Organisational**. These are the company's staff schedule, statutes, labour
  regulations. This group also includes rules for organising workplaces,
  regulations, contracts with employees.

- **Regulatory**. They include orders for the enterprise, instructions, control
  over the execution of tasks. In case of non-execution of orders by the
  personnel, appropriate sanctions are applied.

- **Material**. If an employee has caused damage to the company, management has
  the right to claim the amount of the damage or deduct the amount from the
  bonus.

- **Disciplinary**. These include warnings and penalties, demotion or dismissal.

Due to the use of administrative methods of personnel management, the strict
execution of management orders is ensured. They help to maintain strict
discipline in the company, which has a positive impact on the efficiency and
productivity of labour. On the basis of administrative methods, personnel
incentive systems are developed.

### **Economic**

These include instruments of material incentives for employees, as well as
financial penalties imposed on personnel in case of failure to fulfil their
assigned obligations. The choice of the appropriate method is based on the form
of ownership of the enterprise, the remuneration system it has chosen, and the
tax and credit system in which the company operates. The application of these
methods makes it possible to achieve the following results:

- Prepare an economic development plan with long-term goals and service
  calculations.

- Get consistent, predictable results.

- Increase the payroll through the creation of additional employee benefits.

Economical\` methods are applied taking into account their payback. That is,
investing money in the material support of employees should bring profit as a
result of increasing their efficiency and productivity.

### **Socio-psychological**

It implies organisation of relations between employees and management,
maintenance of a favourable atmosphere within the team. Psychological techniques
are used to influence individual employees, while sociological techniques are
used to influence the team. They help to determine the place of each employee in
the team, to identify team leaders, to eliminate conflicts on industrial
grounds. They include:

- Involvement of employees in management processes;

- support of social, ethical norms of company management;

- organising groups according to the interests, hobbies and positions of
  employees;

- satisfaction of the spiritual and moral needs of the staff;

- Maintaining a sense of self-worth and value among employees.

This group also includes social support for employees, including social
packages, transport benefits, mobile phone payments and other bonuses from the
company.

Psychological management methods are of a personalised nature. They are aimed at
improving the working atmosphere in the company. They help to create optimal
conditions for the development of employees. They include:

- Creating a favourable emotional environment in the team;

- Analysing staff motivation;

- Conflict Resolution;

- Professional development of employees, development of professional skills;

- Formation of corporate culture in the company.

These methods are implemented through surveys and questionnaires of employees,
conducting social experiments at workplaces. One of the main advantages of
applying social and psychological impact on employees: minimising conflicts at
workplaces, improving their motivation and emotional state.These methods are
