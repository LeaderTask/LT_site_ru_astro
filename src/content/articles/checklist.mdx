Human memory is not unlimited. It is impossible to keep in one's head many
important tasks, everyday tasks that require prompt execution during the day.
And even more so to control the time and quality of their fulfillment. To work
with large volumes of information, its timely systematization,
project-management uses a special tool - check-list, which is a checklist of
cases, tasks that require mandatory check after completion.

## What it is

A check list is a list of actions in the form of a to-do list, in which marks
are made after each step has been completed. With the help of a check list, you
can control any process: from launching a new project at your company to
starting a machine or manufacturing equipment. Using checklists, it is easier to
avoid mistakes when performing repetitive tasks. In front of your eyes you will
always have a complete form that tells you how to perform each step efficiently
and competently according to the sample. For the first time checklists began to
be written in the field of aviation. After the crash of a new model of Boeing in
1934, which happened as a result of a flight crew error, it became clear that it
was difficult for pilots to control the processes of takeoff, flight and landing
without losing sight of important details. Therefore, detailed aircraft
maintenance instructions were developed to explain what to do in ordinary,
critical or dangerous situations.

The first production checklists were used to control and test complex
technologies and technical processes. Gradually checklists began to be used in
other spheres of human life. A properly compiled to-do list will help you get
rid of nervous tension that inevitably arises when trying to keep in your head
an endless number of routine daily tasks. Filling out a checklist perfectly
motivates, raises self-esteem. In the process of going through the checklist,
noting the fulfillment of the next item, a person feels a sense of satisfaction,
realizing that the next task has been achieved. This means that he is even
closer on the way to achieving the main goal.

Proper check-lists come in household and professional. Writing check-lists is
very useful in running a business or personal life. Today we will try to tell
you why and how to make a check-list, how to design a check-list, its
properties, how it differs from other lists and what functions it performs.

## Distinctive features

Quite often this tool is compared to step-by-step plans, guidebooks or to-do
lists. In some sources, the names to do list and checklist are referred to as
synonyms. But, such a statement is incorrect, considering how a checklist looks
like. These tools really help to memorize information, simplify the control of
tasks. Here their common features end.

### Distinction from the to-do list

To-do lists are used to work on specific tasks. For example, making a cake
should consist of these steps: buying the necessary ingredients, preparing the
equipment, kneading, baking the dough, washing the dishes, etc. In the to-do
list, tasks can be swapped, removed or rescheduled. The checklist requires that
every action on the checklist be completed.

### Distinction from the bagpipe

A guide is a guide to action, or a test experience. It is an introduction or
practical recommendations for dummies on how best to perform a particular task
by following a sequence of steps. As an example, you can give a guide to working
in Photoshop or a recipe for a dish.

### Difference from the plan

A step-by-step plan is a step-by-step instruction that must be followed exactly
within the plan to achieve the desired result. And in a checklist, the sequence
of actions is not so important. The main thing is that all the items described
in it are done.

## What it's for

![checklist task](/dlya-chego-nuzhen-checklist-1024x428.webp)

The main purpose of checklists is to structure, organize daily to-do's. They
help:

- Write all daily tasks in a single list.

- See that they are completed on time.

- Next, check the result and the progress made.

Such a designer is necessary to organize efficient work on processes. Checklists
are used by different employees. For example, in restaurants or fast food
establishments. Such lists are given to bartenders, waiters, cooks of the
establishment after a preliminary briefing. After the briefing, they can begin
their independent duties.

Checklists are used by testers at special services to check the serviceability
of complex equipment or to check the indicator of fire safety problems in
buildings and structures. Checklists are also often used in testing and
research.

Nowadays, they have evolved from a paper list into a complete digital product
that can be delivered to an audience as a file that remains practical and
informative. There is a huge variety of them, they are sold, used to attract
leads, the basis for collecting contact details from customers or used as
bonuses for purchases.

## Advantages of application

Helps to display the content of the process in a list, solving a variety of
tasks related to daily planning. With a checklist, you can break down any
complex process into individual steps without losing sight of any important
details. Working with a checklist improves productivity. Reduces the chance of
mistakes, helps you focus on serious processes. Other benefits:

- Simplifying delegation of authority. With detailed instructions in the
  checklist, it will be easier for employees to deal with the tasks assigned to
  them without the threat of loss of quality.

- Practical help to the manager in tracking the progress of work with the
  ability to make corrections at any stage. Thanks to a clear checklist
  algorithm, it is much easier and faster to check tasks.

- Motivation and self-discipline. The visualization of the work process gives
  strength and desire to complete the planned tasks as soon as possible. Seeing
  your progress, a person gets additional incentive for further work, realizes
  how much work is done and how much is left.

- High-quality analytics. All checklist information can be opened and
  structured, converted into graphs, charts or bar charts that clearly show
  productivity changes.

- Improving work processes. By following the right instructions, employees will
  do the job the way it needs to be done. They will not overlook any important
  points on the checklist.

- Time management. By working from a template, staff won't have to spend time
  planning their day on a daily basis, which means that employees will have a
  clear understanding of how and what to do next.

That is, checklists help to effectively organize work processes, to track the
progress made or the result obtained, to assess whether the service or product
received meets the established requirements.

## Rules of drafting

Checklists fall into two main groups:

- Read-Do. They are essential for newcomers. By reading a manual, employees
  follow the steps in the manual one by one, noting the steps that have been
  completed.

- Do-Confirm (Execute and check execution). This option will be convenient for
  professionals who need self-monitoring. In this case, after the tasks are
  completed, their correctness is checked against the list.

Drawing up a checklist is not a complicated process, but it does require
following some rules:

- One checklist item - one action. This will make it easier to navigate through
  the checklist.

- The affirmative or imperative form of the checklist for all items. For the
  Read-Do format, the following tasks would be correct: Order promotional
  booklets. Pay for the order. Pick up the finished products. For a Do-Confirm
  list: Ordered the booklets. Paid. Pick up the products.

- The whole cycle should fit into 20 items. If there are more, the task is
  broken down into several subtasks and a separate checklist is made for each
  one.

- Entries should be concise and brief. No more than 5 words per paragraph.

- Only essential information directly affecting the outcome should be listed.

Complex lists are color-coded. Each task is assigned its own color. Set a
deadline for each step. This makes it easier to control the workflow.

## Options for everyday life

![checklists for everyday life](/checklist-v-povsednevnoi-zhizni-1024x428.webp)

For personal use, the following formats are suitable:

- **Useful Habits Tracker**. The main function is to track a regularly recurring
  action. For example, a checklist for attending a gym class or drinking water
  before meals every day.

- **Bingo**. This format has become widespread in social networks. It looks like
  an image divided into sectors, each of which contains a phrase characterizing
  people's behavior. If it corresponds to your life position, it is crossed out
  or put a check mark next to it. The topics can be absolutely any. For example:
  "Work meetings", "Finances" or "Learning Spanish".

- **A list of mistakes**. Its purpose is to remind you of the most common
  mistakes and to prevent their repetition. This format is suitable for checking
  the work done by contractors.

- **Lifehacks, useful tips**. Aimed at optimizing any processes. For example,
  how to do something, tips on how to make a resume, learn Spanish in 20 steps,
  etc.

## Processes and objectives

Processes are specific actions on the way to achieving a goal. They can be
one-time or periodic: daily, weekly, quarterly. In checklists, processes are
written out in the form of individual steps that need to be taken to solve the
task at hand. Example: a list of things to do for a trip.

Checklists are convenient to use for controlling various processes:

- Progress checks when tracking key tasks in time management or project
  management.

- Checks the correctness of the completed work. The criteria can be used to
  assess how well and professionally the assignment has been completed.

- Estimates of the technical characteristics of the product. Example: supporting
  documentation indicating the amount of RAM, system performance of a computer
  or other complex machinery.

- Collecting data for analysis. If you are collecting information about
  potential competitors, you will find it easier to organize your information
  based on points.

## How to make a checklist

Checklists are created on plain paper, spreadsheets, modern text editors. The
information field is divided into three columns. In the first one write down the
item numbers, in the second one - the essence of the task, and in the third one
put a mark on its fulfillment. One paragraph contains one action described in
several words. The information contained in it should not be a reason for
thinking. Only concrete actions and a mark of completion.

It should fit completely on the main screen of a computer, other digital device,
without the need to scroll down. It is desirable to use no more than two colors
to highlight important information, so that you are not distracted by bright
elements while using the tool.

If you don't know how to create a check-list that will be a step-by-step guide
for your work and personal life, specialized digital services can help you.
