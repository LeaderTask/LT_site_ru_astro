A to do list app enables you to compose a checklist of tasks and keep track of
their accomplishment. It helps you organize your time more productively and
efficiently achieve your personal and business goals. Many digital planners of
this type also offer additional functionality – such as setting reminders for
your todos, prioritizing items, sharing contents with others, delegating tasks,
exchanging files and so on. In this article, we'd like to recommend you top task
apps for various devices. Readers with any needs and budget should be able to
find something for their taste.

## How to Choose a Task Manager App

When selecting the best to do list app, it makes sense to focus on these four
parameters:

- Aesthetic merits. According to modern design trends, the interface of a good
  to-do list app should be minimalistic and uncluttered. However, some products
  successfully target customers with other visual preferences. Some users value
  customization opportunities – while others perceive them as an excessive
  add-on.

- Cross-platform and cross-device compatibility. You might be able to access
  your task list manager from your computer and mobile phone. It can be
  available in the cloud format, as a website or an app for Mac, Windows,
  Android, iPhone and iPad. To cut down expenses, some developers make their
  products compatible only with selected gadgets and operating systems.

- Features. A simple tool can let you compose and edit a to do list. Most
  advanced solutions offer many other features, such as shareable content, time
  trackers, calendar integrations and so on. Some products are equally suitable
  for private and business use – while others were designed to manage only your
  personal affairs.

- Pricing. Most developers ask their clients to pay for monthly or annual
  subscriptions. Selected programs offer in-app purchases. Besides, there are
  entirely free solutions and the ones that you can buy at a fixed price.

The apps that we'll list in our article differ considerably by their
characteristics. All of them have a free version unless stated otherwise.

## 1\. LeaderTask

![LeaderTask](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.8

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $2.18

👍 Reason to praise: Highest level of user-friendliness

👎 Reason to criticize: Steep learning curve for some clients

It's a highly popular solution among private users and business teams. Its
functionality is diverse and extensive. Todos are the base that you can start
with. You can create an unlimited number of them, flexibly modify their
settings, split them into subtasks, place them in the desired sequence on your
time scale, attach various types of files to them, access these files after the
task is completed and perform many other functions. The app enables you to
create tasks with minimum effort from email messages and widgets in the Mozilla
Firefox browser. You can make tasks recurring within any necessary time interval
– even such long ones as once per quarter or once per year. The Focus feature
will help you concentrate on high-priority items without getting distracted.

[LeaderTask](/downloads) offers handy reminders and notifications that won't let
you forget about your to-dos. Reminders are linked to a specific moment in time
– they go off as alarm signals. Notifications inform you about events and
updates – for instance, about the fact that someone replied to your message.
Whenever you need to find a specific item, you'll be able to do it quickly with
the help of the search function. You can prioritize, sort and label your todos
to better navigate between them.

When working with a team, you'll be able to assign and delegate tasks to others,
monitor their progress and evaluate the individual achievements of each member.
LeaderTask allows you to modify the status and rights of each participant so
that they can access only that part of the content that corresponds to their
responsibilities.

You don't need to always remain online to be able to work in LeaderTask. All its
features are available offline, which is especially important for frequent
travelers. The only exception is messages: you can write and send them while
you're offline – and they will be transferred to the recipient as soon as you
restore your Internet connection.

## 2\. Todoist

![ToDoIst](/ToDoist-Planner-1024x655.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.7

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $4

👍 Reason to praise: Extensive range of features

👎 Reason to criticize: Limited collaboration opportunities

Judging by the app's interface, you might think its functionality is simplistic.
But that would be an illusion. It suits both private and business users. It lets
you create todos, join them in tasks, set reminders, select themes and track
your productivity. When working with a team, you'll be able to launch multiple
projects simultaneously, invite collaborators, use a shared inbox and discuss
your workflows within the app.

The task management features of Todoist are rather extensive. However, its
collaboration features are a bit limited, compared to alternatives.

## 3\. TickTick

![TickTick](/ticktick-app-1024x576.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.7

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $3

👍 Reason to praise: Easy onboarding

👎 Reason to criticize: Limited functionality of the free version

TickTick is compatible with many different operating systems and devices,
including smartwatches. It boasts a shallow learning curve and easy onboarding.
Its interface is intuitive and you can set it up as an add-on for your Gmail and
Outlook. This to-do list maker lets you create tasks from emails, make recurring
tasks, use your voice to input content, benefit from Siri and widgets, monitor
your productivity and create alerts, including "annoying" ones. The term
"annoying" means that you'll fail to disable the alert until you complete the
task. The collaborative opportunities are impressive. You'll be able to share
your content with others and assign tasks to third parties. The features for
searching and filtering items are very decent.

To make the most of TickTick, be ready to upgrade to a paid plan.

## 4\. OmniFocus

![OmniFocus](/OmniFocus_img-1024x648.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.7

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $4.99

👍 Reason to praise: Solid business functionality

👎 Reason to criticize: Lack of Windows and Android version

This product is a part of the complex Omni ecosystem, purposefully designed for
business. It includes solutions for time planning, project management, visual
communications and other needs. If you'd like to use this app as a private
individual, its sophistication might overwhelm you in the first few days. But
for organization freaks, it's obviously bliss.

The interface of OmniFocus is sleek. Just like most other solutions from our
list, it lets you create tasks, join them into projects, set deadlines for them
and categorize them with tags. Besides, there are many add-ons that make this
product stand out from the rest. For instance, you can use keyboard shortcuts to
create tasks, benefit from the Forecast feature to assess your upcoming to-dos
and employ the Perspectives feature to group similar actions together. The app
won't let you get off the track – while completing a project, you'll be able to
check whether your every step aligns with your ultimate goals.

OmniFocus lacks apps for Windows and Android. But people who use these operating
systems can access the web version of the app – and by the way, it's the most
affordable one. If you're an Apple user, it will be easy for you to sync the
content from the app across all your devices.

## 5\. Trello

![Trello](/Trello_Calendar-1024x554.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.6

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $5

👍 Reason to praise: Versatility and flexibility

👎 Reason to criticize: Inability to display task dependencies

You can access Trello from nearly any device and platform. It lets you create a
card for each of your to-dos, merge cards into lists and compose checklists. To
prioritize items or relocate them from one list to another, you can use the
drag-and-drop feature. Such an approach to visualization enables you to monitor
the progress of each task and their distribution between team members. For each
task, you can assign a due date, add a custom label and attach files. The app
allows you to set reminders. They can act as alerts to prevent you from missing
something important – or inform you about changes and updates.

Trello is a powerful project management tool whose interface you can flexibly
customize. It integrates with many other products. The major drawback of this
otherwise very decent app is its inability to display task dependencies.

## 6\. nTask

![nTask](/ntask.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.6

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $3

👍 Reason to praise: Ability to cater to a very wide audience

👎 Reason to criticize: Steep learning curve

This one caters to literally any type of user: from a private individual to an
enterprise. Its interface is sleek and minimalistic. It was built for managing
not only tasks and projects but also meetings, timesheets, bugs and risks. Its
report and visualization features are indispensable for professionals who
supervise large teams and complex projects. You can benefit from Kanban boards
and Gantt charts.

nTask is a very powerful and versatile product, available across different
platforms. But you might prefer to access it from your computer because its
mobile apps are not too perfect yet.

## 7\. Hive

![Hive](/hive-1024x648.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.6

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $12

👍 Reason to praise: AI-powered tool to generate content

👎 Reason to criticize: Automation opportunities can be limited for very large
teams

It's a popular app for hybrid and remote work, available in desktop and mobile
formats. It lets you create to-dos, split them into subtasks, set deadlines for
them, merge them into projects and assign them to third parties. You'll be able
to set goals, track the process of achieving them, take notes, benefit from
reports and integrate Hive with over 1000 third-party products. This solution
allows you to choose between calendar and Kanban view. To check all the upcoming
todos as a single list, you can switch to the My Actions view. An AI-powered
tool can help you generate content and plan your activities.

There is a chat and a native email in the app that you can rely on to discuss
tasks collaboratively. Even though Hive is perfectly suitable for teamwork, its
automation opportunities can be limited for very large groups.

## 8\. Habitica

![Habitica](/Habitica_APP-1024x579.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.6

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $4.99

👍 Reason to praise: Gamification approach

👎 Reason to criticize: Lack of the desktop version

Habitica is an open-source product, which means anyone who has relevant
technical expertise can contribute to its development. It's a firm favorite
among the young audience who doesn't need to deal with formal task management.
This app turns the process of organizing your schedule into a role-playing game.
Such an approach helps even the laziest users boost their motivation. You can
create a funny avatar for yourself and let it achieve goals. In exchange for
completing tasks, you'll receive in-app awards and your customization
opportunities will expand. There will be penalties for what you promised but
failed to deliver.

When it comes to shortcomings, Habitica lacks a desktop version. Plus, it's a
niche product that is hardly suitable for the business environment.

## 9\. Any.do

![AnyDo](/anydo.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.6

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $3

👍 Reason to praise: Suitable for business with multi-national distributed teams

👎 Reason to criticize: Slightly lower level of user-friendliness, compared to
alternatives from the top of our list

Any.do is popular among companies whose staff members live in different
countries and work from different devices. It supports multiple languages and
has handy versions for various platforms. Private individuals can benefit from
it too – and the app's pricing should be affordable for them. The functionality
of the free version is rather limited.

When you get started with this product, it might seem straightforward. But when
you switch to exploring its more advanced features, it might require time and
effort. Comprehensive templates will help you make your first steps. There is a
daily planner, project management features, collaboration tools and a built-in
chat. You can customize your workflows, assign tasks to others and integrate the
app with third-party solutions.

## 10\. Microsoft To Do

![Microsoft To Do](/Microsoft-To-Do_img-1024x704.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.5

🏳️ Monthly price of the most-budget friendly version: Entirely free to use

👍 Reason to praise: Integration with other products by the same brand

👎 Reason to criticize: Poor integrations with third-party solutions

Even though it's a Microsoft solution, it's not limited exclusively to the
Windows operating system. You can access it from an Apple computer as well as
various smartphones. The app integrates with other products by the same brand.
However, its compatibility with the solutions built by other developers is
limited.

You won't have to pay a single cent to start using the app. But it's necessary
to register a Microsoft account if you don't have it yet. You'll be able to
create tasks, join them in lists, split them into subtasks, add deadlines to
them, set reminders and share your content with others. On the flip side,
collaboration opportunities are limited. This simple app is much better suited
for private and not business use.

## 11\. Google Tasks

![Google Tasks](/google_tasks-1024x638.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.5

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: Entirely free to use

👍 Reason to praise: Handy reminders and notifications

👎 Reason to criticize: Limited functionality

To use this app, you don't need to pay a single cent. It's enough to create a
Google account – which you're likely to have if you use Gmail or watch YouTube.
Google Tasks have an intuitive interface and smoothly integrate with the other
products by the same developer. It can function as a separate solution – or an
add-on for Gmail or Google Calendar. You can access it in the format of an app
or a Chrome extension. You'll be able to comfortably manage your todos as a
private user – but it's not the best product for business purposes because it
lacks collaborative features.

## 12\. Remember the Milk

![Remember The Milk](/remembertm.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.5

🏳️ Annual price of the most-budget friendly version: $49.99 – be ready to pay it
in one go

👍 Reason to praise: Functional offline mode

👎 Reason to criticize: Lack of monthly subscription

It's easy to use and its interface is uncluttered. You can install it as a
mobile app or access it through a web interface. When you'll be getting started,
Remember the Milk will guide you through the process with the help of a
comprehensive tutorial. After you create a task, you'll be able to divide it
into as many subtasks as you find necessary, attach files to them, delegate them
and categorize them with the help of colorful tags. The app lets you make tasks
recurring, assign priority levels to them and set due dates for them. One of the
most noteworthy features is smart lists, which are special lists based on search
criteria. Remember the Milk integrates with various third-party products and can
send you reminders through multiple channels, including email.

Unfortunately, there is no monthly subscription. You can get the taste of the
app in its free version – and if you need more functions, be ready to fork out
for the full price of the annual subscription in one go.

## 13\. Things 3

![Things](/Things-3_img-1024x875.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.5

🏳️ Price: $10 – it's the price of the one-time purchase because there is no
subscription

👍 Reason to praise: Remarkably user-friendly interface

👎 Reason to criticize: Lack of a free version – but you can benefit from a free
trial

This app allows you to create tasks, categorize them with tags, compose them
into lists, set due dates and reminders for them and make them recurring. You'll
be able to join multiple tasks into projects and areas – Work, Shopping, Finance
or Health can serve as examples of areas. The app supports calendar view and
calendar integrations. It can conveniently display your plans for the near
future – such as today, today's evening or tomorrow. There are no collaboration
features, so it's not the best solution for working in a group. But it's a
worthy product for private use.

Things 3 lacks a monthly or annual subscription. It's available only as a
one-off purchase, which can help you save money in the long run. There is no
free version – but you can benefit from a free trial. Some users perceive such a
pricing model as an obstacle. Nevertheless, the audience of the app is already
large and keeps expanding because many people like this approach to pricing.

## 14\. Toodledo

![](/todledo.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.5

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $3.99

👍 Reason to praise: Flexible customization

👎 Reason to criticize: Outdated interface

This one is available as a mobile app and in the web format – but not as a
desktop app. Its interface looks a bit vintage – but for some people, it's an
advantage. The task management functionality is not too extensive – but pretty
much enough to manage your to-dos. You can create tasks, sort and filter them,
set due dates and reminders for them, split them into subtasks, add tags to
them, set goals and perform many other helpful functions. The collaboration
opportunities are limited – so you might want to look for alternatives if you
need to work with a team.

## 15\. WorkFlowy

![](/Workflowy.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.5

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $4.08

👍 Reason to praise: Ease of use

👎 Reason to criticize: Limited functionality

It's a very basic todolist application, spot-on for people who have never used
this type of software before. It's available in the web format and has apps for
desktops and smartphones. Its interface is minimalistic and its drag-and-drop
functionality comes in very handy for managing your content. You can add tags to
your todos, zoom in and out to focus on high-priority items, switch to the
Kanban board view and resort to infinite nesting. The search function is
powerful.

WorkFlowy might be not suitable for people who need an enterprise-grade
electronic organizer. If you're looking for a project management solution with
advanced collaborative features, you'd better consider alternatives.

## 16\. Way of Life

![](/way-of-life.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.5

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $4.99

👍 Reason to praise: Charts to review the trends of your personal progress

👎 Reason to criticize: Lack of KPI tracking tools

This solution helps you get rid of bad habits and acquire good ones. It's ideal
for people who deal with recurring to-dos. Way of Life enables you to detect the
reasons for your undesirable habits and eliminate them. Charts will outline the
negative and positive trends of your life over different time periods, such as
one week or one year. You can color-code items, benefit from powerful reminders
and add notes to tasks. To customize this instrument even further and get access
to its most sophisticated features, you can make in-app purchases.

It would be only natural if you expected to find KPIs tracking tools in this
habit tracker. Unfortunately, it lacks them.

## 17\. Sunsama

![](/sunsama-1024x549.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.4

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $16

👍 Reason to praise: Seamless integrations with third-party products

👎 Reason to criticize: Expensive subscription

This product was designed to facilitate the process of building your daily
schedule. It's available in desktop and mobile formats. You can sync it with
calendar apps and check your plans from the interfaces of third-party products.
After you compose a list of tasks, you won't have to put a lot of effort into
managing it. If you fail to complete a specific to-do on time, Sunsama will
automatically reschedule it for tomorrow. The app offers comprehensive analytics
and a chance to use keyboard shortcuts. There are many visual modes to select
from, including the focus one, the dark one and the weekly review.

The most significant shortcoming of this solution is its high price.

## 18\. Coda

![](/coda-1024x653.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.4

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $10

👍 Reason to praise: Excellent data visualization

👎 Reason to criticize: Too complex for individuals who are interested only in
to-dos

This app lets you create, view and edit documents. By default, it's a project
management solution for teams. However, it can also double as a to-do list app
for individuals or groups. You can create an unlimited number of tasks, track
their accomplishment, merge them into projects and use a dashboard for reports.
The visualization opportunities are impressive. You can embed tables in your
content and carry out complex calculations.

For individuals who are interested only in to-dos, Coda is a bit too complex.
But if you need the functionality that we described in the previous passage,
this product has few competitors.

## 19\. TeuxDeux

![](/TeuxDeux-1024x627.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.4

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $3

👍 Reason to praise: Genuine simplicity

👎 Reason to criticize: Lack of advanced functionality

The developers of TeuxDeux drew inspiration from oldschool paper notebooks. They
wanted their product to look as simple as possible and make the lives of its
users calmer. While many other apps from our list put an emphasis on
productivity, this one strives to alleviate stress. You can create tasks, split
them into subtasks, organize them into lists, add notes to them, set deadlines
and benefit from reminders. If you aren't sure about specific todos, feel free
to classify them as Someday/Maybe. The app can send you daily emails with
digests of your tasks.

TeuxDeux lives up to its original concept and lacks sophisticated functionality.
Some users perceive it as its competitive edge – and others as a drawback.

## 20\. Evernote

![Evernote](/evernote.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.4

🏳️ Monthly price of the most cost-efficient subscription: $10.83

👍 Reason to praise: Unique built-in features

👎 Reason to criticize: Limited project management functionality

As its name suggests, this one was conceived as an app for taking notes.
However, its functionality goes far beyond this mission. It enables you to sync
your notes across multiple devices. Besides, you can add tasks, create
checklists, tag items, set reminders and build templates for recurring tasks.
You'll be able to customize the app's interface with the help of diverse
widgets. The Web Clipper browser extension allows you to save any exciting
information that you come across on the Internet. There is a scanner in the app
that facilitates handling printed documents.

You can use Evernote for teamwork. But its functionality in this aspect is not
as rich as that of its more advanced alternatives.

## Final Thoughts

A to-do list app comes in handy for managing your daily and weekly schedule. It
lets you compose one or multiple lists of tasks, prioritize and edit them, make
them recurring, split them into subtasks, attach files to them, assign tasks to
other users and perform many other functions. When selecting the product that
best suits your needs, you should pay primary attention to its design,
functionality and price as well as cross-device and cross-platform
compatibility.

There are many noteworthy solutions of this sort on the market. However, we'd
like to particularly recommend LeaderTask to you. It's much more than just a
regular check list app. It's a powerful and versatile solution for managing your
time, tasks and projects. Its interface is intuitive, its prices are affordable
and it's compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms. It's equally
suitable for managing to-dos of a private individual or a business of any size.
