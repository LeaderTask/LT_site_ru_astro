Every manager faces crises in the course of his work. The further development
and success of the business largely depends on how correct and balanced his
decision will be at that moment. But how to understand what option will be
effective and correct? A huge number of thoughts appear in your head, confused
with your own worries and doubts, preventing you from adequately assessing the
situation. But if you look at it differently, from a different angle, it can
lead to the choice of the right option. Everything seems simple and clear, but
how to do it in real conditions? The 6 Hats method developed by Edward de Bono,
a well-known psychologist and expert, will help.

## What is the essence of the "6 Hats of Thinking" method

![Six hats method](/six-hats-original-1024x534.webp)

It is a special technique of organizing thoughts to help you consider a
situation from different angles in order to make a correct and balanced
decision. This method is based on the concept of parallel thinking. Many
decisions are made through arguments, debates and discussions. In such
circumstances, the more persuasive and actively promoted option is often
recognized as the correct one. But it is not always the correct one. When using
the 6 Hats method, opposing versions, opinions, and approaches do not "clash,"
but peacefully neighbor each other.

This technique is a kind of brainstorming or role-playing game, where 6 hats of
different colors are six ways of thinking. Literally or mentally trying them on,
the person plays the appropriate role, looking at the problem from a certain
point of view.

By changing hats, the perspective of the issue changes:

## Blue (strategic thinking)

![Strategic thinking](/strategy.webp)

Responsible for setting goals, managing the process, processing the information
received. The person who puts it on becomes a moderator, leading the discussion.
He sets goals, tasks, asks leading questions, summarizes the results. He does
not argue with other hat wearers, does not evaluate their statements. It depends
on him how constructive and useful the conversation will be.

The wearer of the blue hat asks himself the following questions:

- Where do I start communicating?

- What is the topic to be discussed?

- What goals need to be achieved?

- In what order should hats of other colors be used?

- How will the results be summarized?

- What will be the outline of the discussion?

The blue hat task is to see the task from the top, make a work plan, analyze the
information received and draw conclusions based on it. Strategic thinking is
required to manage these processes.

The blue hat can be passed around to other group members so that everyone can
participate in shaping the plan and the nature of the conversation. They can
make adjustments to the rules, ban certain topics, or contribute other ideas
that enhance the conversation.

**_For example:_**

"To make our discussion productive, I suggest we set the time limit for each
participant to speak at 10 minutes."

"I believe it is not worth wasting time discussing this issue as it has already
been decided."

## Red (emotions, experiences)

![Emotional thinking](/mindset.webp)

According to psychologists, the answers to many questions lie in the
subconscious. Trying on this hat, a person gives free rein to his emotions and
intuition. He shares with others his fears, experiences, joy, admiration, freely
expresses any of his feelings without justifying or limiting their
manifestations. This is important when dealing with complex and emotionally
filled problems. The main thing is to be extremely honest and sincere towards
yourself and other participants in the discussion.

Here are questions that would be appropriate for the wearer of the red hat:

- What am I feeling right now?

- How do I assess the current situation: positively or negatively?

- What does my "gut feeling" tell me about this?

Based on your emotional reactions, you will understand the consequences of your
decisions. This will help you take steps to prevent them. Using this hat helps
you to see the subject matter from the outside.

When using a "red hat" it is important to keep the following points in mind:

1. Time limits of up to 30 seconds are set for reasoning.

2. You can talk freely about your feelings without making excuses for other
   people.

**_Example:_**

" I wouldn't buy this product because of the unfortunate design."

"I have to be involved in the discussion on this topic because the decision made
on it will affect my career with the company."

If you feel like your decision is the right one, but you are experiencing some
anxiety in your soul, this is a reason to think about reconsidering it.

## White (analytical thinking)

![Analytical thinking](/analytical.webp)

It is associated with analytics, i.e. with dry figures and facts. Putting on
this hat, a person concentrates on finding and analyzing the necessary
information, selecting sources where it can be obtained. Here are the questions
that are associated with the white hat:

- What data do we have at our disposal?

- What information is missing from the discussion?

- Where can I find her?

The wearer of the white-colored hat captures opposing viewpoints. Analyzes,
evaluates the accuracy of the information provided. Separates real facts from
hypotheses and assumptions. Summarizes the results achieved: what has been done
so far to solve the problem, what attempts are being made to eliminate it, what
more can be done to achieve the desired result.

**_Example:_**

"Our sales were down 10% this month. At the same time, the average check
increased by 15%. I believe this is due to an increase in the price of our
company's goods.

"We conducted an internal investigation to address the issue. It revealed more
than 10 violations of technical norms."

That is, the wearer of the white hat is an outside observer stating specific
facts.

## Black (critical thinking)

![Critical thinking](/critical.webp)

Her task is to conduct research on the issue under discussion in order to
clarify the consequences of each decision. The man in the black hat assesses
potential risks, looks for hidden threats, identifies weaknesses in the issue
under discussion. He backs up his criticisms with concrete arguments. He is
given the privilege of interrupting participants wearing other hats. His
questions:

- What problems might arise in implementing this idea?

- Where can miscalculations and mistakes be made?

- Where is it better to be careful?

Using this hat helps to generate a negative scenario for each decision in order
to develop an effective plan of action in unconventional and difficult
situations.

**_For example:_**

"I believe it is time for us to stop investing money in this project until it
pays off. So far, it brings only losses to the company, and there is no result".

"I am sure this update will be useless for the client as we have not done any
prior analysis of the target audience."

## Yellow (optimism)

![Positive thinking](/positive.webp)

A positive outlook on life helps to unlock inner resources and see prospects for
growth. The following issues are associated with the yellow color:

- What else can I do?

- How does this help the problem?

- What benefit will I get?

- Why should it work?

The wearer of this hat sees positive aspects in everything and makes positive
predictions for the future.

**_Example:_**

"We've assembled a great team, so we'll handle the project in minimal time."

"With such an affordable price and excellent quality, our product is sure to
appeal to customers."

## Green (creative thinking)

![Creative thinking](/creative.webp)

It implies a creative approach to any case involving non-standard solutions.
Creative thinking is important in cases where other methods did not bring the
desired result. The man in the green hat fantasizes, proposes any seemingly
crazy and strange ideas. Then they are tested for viability and analyzed by the
wearers of yellow and black hats.

Issues related to this role:

- What creative ideas do I have?

- Are there any alternatives to this solution?

- What are some ways to avoid the difficulties indicated by the wearer of the
  black hat?

**_For example:_**

"What if we do the exact opposite?"

"Let's turn on the inner child. What would he want in this situation?"

Each participant of the conversation can express his/her thoughts and ideas
without limiting the flight of fancy. It is better to use a green hat after a
black one, when there is a clear understanding of the possible consequences of
certain decisions.

## Method rules

There are a number of rules to follow when applying the 6 hats technique:

1. The optimal number of participants for a discussion is 6 people. But,
   depending on the problem to be solved, the number can be larger or smaller.

2. The game has a facilitator who coordinates and establishes the order of the
   speeches. He or she reminds each hat wearer of his or her role, introduces
   them to each other, and explains how they will interact with each other.

3. The hats can be real or virtual. The discussion ends when all participants
   have worn them.

4. It is desirable to record the ideas, thoughts and recommendations expressed.
   A blackboard or a tape recorder can be used for this purpose.

5. After summarizing the results of the conversation, the facilitator provides
   the results to all team members.

The order of putting on the hats may look as follows:

- A white hat opens the conversation. Facts, specific data related to the topic
  under discussion are discussed.

- The wearer of the black hat enters the conversation. He provides the same
  information in a negative light to find problem areas.

- Behind him, the yellow hat speaks out, with a positive view of the problems
  outlined.

- The green hat is used only after the situation has been thoroughly
  investigated and considered from all sides.

- The red hat is used for defusing, on rare occasions.

Next, the yellow and black hats are repeated. Their task is to double-check the
new ideas. The bearer of the blue hat concludes the discussion. He summarizes
the results of the event.
