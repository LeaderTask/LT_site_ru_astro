A productivity app can make you more efficient in your private and professional
life. It can do it in many ways. Some solutions help you manage your time,
tasks, and projects. Others minimize distractions and help you focus on
high-priority duties like a pro. There are solutions that fine-tune your brain
activities, enable you to connect different apps through one dashboard, enhance
business collaboration, automate routine processes, or eliminate background
noise during calls. The notion of "productive apps" is incredibly wide. What
they all share in common is their ultimate goal. They let you achieve your
objectives faster, with less effort, and with great precision. In this article,
we'll list the best productivity apps of many kinds. Everyone will be able to
find something to meet their demands!

## Tips on Choosing Productivity Apps

When comparing cool productivity apps, it's essential to pay attention to the
following factors:

- Purpose. Some apps are better suited for boosting your self-motivation at
  home. Others were designed for the business environment, be it high-tech or
  industrial production management. Besides, there are many versatile products
  that cater to the widest possible audience.

- Platform compatibility. Most apps today are available in the following
  versions: web, iOS, Android, and desktop for several operating systems. With
  some products, all the versions are equally powerful. With others, some
  versions outperform others. Besides, selected apps might lack specific
  versions at all.

- Price. It's a standard today to offer a free plan and/or trial. The trial
  typically lasts for one or two weeks. It might be necessary to upgrade to
  premium to unlock more features or to be allowed to use the app
  collaboratively with a large group.

- UX/UI. Make sure the app seems visually appealing and easy to use for you.
  Otherwise, look for alternatives – after all, they are so numerous. Many apps
  let users personalize their designs and choose from multiple themes.

Now, let's have a look at the best apps for productivity! All the solutions that
we'll mention below are well-known in the market and their users have rated them
high. The prices for their paid plans are indicated per individual per month
unless stated otherwise.

## LeaderTask

![Leadertask](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Extensive functionality accessible at a low price

👎 Weakest aspect: Lack of opportunity to send messages offline

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $3.3

💌 Rating: 4.8

So far, it's the best productivity app in our experience. It's a full-fledged
time, task, and project management solution that comes in handy for teams of any
size and solo individuals. It allows you to create an unlimited number of tasks,
split them into subtasks, and merge them into projects. You'll be able to assign
to-dos to others and control their accomplishment. The app lets you modify
access rights for each person involved, distribute team roles, monitor
everyone's contribution, and analyze your team's statistics. There are multiple
built-in tools to boost productivity – such as notifications, reminders, labels,
filters, and smart search. To save time and effort, you can create tasks from
your emails or by using the dedicated widget in the Mozilla Firefox browser. The
Focus feature allows you to fully concentrate on the most important issues,
without getting distracted on minor details. The app is highly customizable and
equally functional on all platforms.

Despite being nearly perfect, LeaderTask has one shortcoming. Nearly all its
functionality remains available offline. The only exception is messages – they
can be sent only with an active Internet connection. However, you can write them
offline and send them as soon as you go back online.

## Hive

![Hive](/hive-1024x575.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Collaboration features

👎 Weakest aspect: Its web and desktop versions outperform its mobile app

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $5

💌 Rating: 4.7

This one is great for team collaboration. The members of your workgroup will be
able to discuss their to-dos, join efforts on competing tasks and composing
schedules, share documents, and track their progress. Everyone can check the
information in the viewing format that suits them best, including Kanban and
Gantt. Hive will let all of your team stay on the same page by showing handy
updates. You'll benefit from the comprehensive My Actions list filled with your
personal tasks.

As for the shortcomings, the Hive mobile app is not as functional as its web and
desktop versions.

## Todoist

![ToDoIst](/ToDoist-Planner-1024x655.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Simplicity coupled with efficiency

👎 Weakest aspect: Limited set of features

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $3.99

💌 Rating: 4.7

Before the digital era, you would compose your to-do list on a physical sheet of
paper. Then, you would cross out the completed tasks one by one. Todoist enables
you to do so on the screen of your computer or cell phone. The app supports
collaboration and is suitable for teamwork. You'll be able to group your tasks
into projects, share them with others, and assign them to others.

However, you shouldn't expect to discover an impressive set of features here.

## Google Docs

![Google Docs](/google-docs-1024x680.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Seamless real-time collaboration on text documents

👎 Weakest aspect: Lack of a desktop app or an opportunity to work offline

🏳️ Entry-level plan: Free to use

💌 Rating: 4.7

As its name suggests, this solution was designed to boost your gross
productivity when working with documents. Before it hit the market, the process
of collaborating on text files used to be cumbersome. You needed to create your
text alone, save it, and send it to another person through your preferred
communication channel, such as email. The recipient would open the document,
edit it, save the changes, and forward it back to you. With Google Docs, it's
enough to share the link to the text file with as many people as you wish. You
can adjust access rights for everyone, letting each person view your text,
comment on it, or edit it. Everyone who has access to the text will be able to
collaborate on it in real-time. You can insert images in your documents, export
them in various formats, and perform many other useful actions.

However, the good old Microsoft Word still outperforms Google Docs in terms of
formatting opportunities. Besides, to work with the latter, you need to go
online and open your browser.

## IFTTT

![IFTTT](/ifttt-1024x581.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Cross-automation between different apps

👎 Weakest aspect: Focus on only one function

🏳️ Entry-level plan: Free to use

💌 Rating: 4.7

The IFTTT acronym stands for If This Then That. You input a condition and
specify which action to take when this condition takes place. For instance, you
can ask the app to notify you every time there are three days left until the
full moon. Or, you may ask it to add an event to the calendar of your choice as
soon as an invitation to an event sent by a particular person lands in your
inbox. IFTTT can automate nearly everything and connect many different apps.
It's indispensable for automating tedious routine to-dos that might distract you
from high-priority issues.

As for the drawbacks, you'd fail to use this product for any other purpose.

## Calendly

![Calendly app](/calendly-1024x605.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Effortless scheduling

👎 Weakest aspect: Limited customization opportunities

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $8

💌 Rating: 4.7

When you sign up for this app, it will ask you to sync your calendar with it.
Then, you'll be required to clarify your availability preferences. There are
various time slots on offer – 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and so on. To schedule a
meeting, it's enough to send your Calendly link to the person and let them pick
the optimal slot. You won't need to waste time and effort on exchanging messages
anymore.

The weakest aspect of Calendly is its limited customization opportunities. It's
a particularly sensitive point for businesses that need active branding.

## Brain.fm

![Brain.fm](/Brain.fm_-1024x415.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Opportunity to fine-tune your brain activities with music

👎 Weakest aspect: Some people are more perceptive to sound therapy while others
less

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $6.99

💌 Rating: 4.6

It's a scientifically proven fact that selected types of music can make you much
more productive. They impact your brain to reach the desired effect – for
example, to make you focus on a challenging task or fall asleep within 15
minutes to have a quick nap in the middle of a busy day. It can be a smart
alternative to having a cup of coffee or a relaxing herbal tea. Let the app know
which result you need – and it will design and play dedicated tunes for you. It
can be a lifesaver for people who are always pressed for time.

On the flip side, what works well with some individuals can have a minimal
impact on others. There is no guarantee that Brain.fm will become a game-changer
for you personally.

## Chanty

![Chanty](/Chanty-1024x641.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Collaboration in video, audio, and chat formats

👎 Weakest aspect: Interface looks messy when you need to juggle too many
projects and teams

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $3

💌 Rating: 4.6

This app simplifies collaboration on tasks within a team. You won't have to
stick to any specific format of communication. Instead, you'll be able to switch
freely between text messages, audio, and video. It will be convenient for you to
create, edit, and distribute tasks. Chanty allows you to easily convert text
messages into tao-dos. During audio and video calls, you can share your screen
with colleagues. If your team works according to the Scrum methodology, feel
free to organize your to-dos on Kanban boards. The app integrates with over 20
third-party solutions, so you'll be able to pull data from there.

Unfortunately, the interface can become messy when you need to juggle too many
projects and teams simultaneously.

## Evernote

![Evernote](/evernote.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Ability to handle handwriting just as efficiently as
digital text

👎 Weakest aspect: Slow speed of innovation

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $4.99

💌 Rating: 4.6

Modern kids and teens often struggle to write by hand and prefer to type
instead. With the older generations, the situation is the exact opposite.
Evernote was launched to bridge the gap between handwriting and digital screens.
Feel free to scribble down anything on a physical sheet of paper and take a
photo of it. The app will recognize your handwriting and will be able to process
it for search purposes. Plus, you can make digital notes in the app. Thanks to
Evernote, you'll be able to store all your thoughts in one place. To manage your
collection of ideas, you can tag and organize them.

This app used to be extremely cool a few years ago. Now, some users complain
about its slow speed of innovation. Evernote integrates new features later than
some of its competitors. In particular, its interface looks outdated.
Nevertheless, this solution remains popular and noteworthy.

## Forest

![Forest app](/forest-app.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Funny gamified approach to boosting productivity

👎 Weakest aspect: Not too suitable for serious business tasks

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $1.99

💌 Rating: 4.6

This one was conceived for individuals who get distracted from work too
frequently. They get down to a task – and in a few minutes, suddenly discover
themselves checking messages or scrolling down social networks on their
smartphones. To stay focused on what needs to be done, plant a virtual tree in
the Forest app before starting a task. The tree will keep growing as long as you
keep working. If you take your phone and get distracted, the tree will die. Over
time, you'll be able to grow a big forest by completing tasks without
distractions. To prevent you from getting bored, the app allows you to make
purchases, listen to calming sounds, and enjoy additional tree species. Its team
has partnered with Trees For The Future – which means you can contribute to
planting real-life forests if you wish.

Such a gamified approach can work wonders for fun-loving solo users. But it's
hardly suitable for the serious business environment.

## Toggl

![Toggl](/Toggl.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Powerful time tracking

👎 Weakest aspect: Inability to cope with many large projects at once

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $8

💌 Rating: 4.6

It's a cool time-tracking tool with a clean UX/UI. Its target audience is very
wide and includes everyone from students to enterprises. It will be easy for you
to assess how much time you or your team spends on specific tasks. You'll be
able to identify what slows you down and improve your working practices. You'll
benefit from the billable hours feature and custom reports.

On the flip side, Toggl might become messy if you overload it with too many
projects. To make the most of it, try to dose its workload.

## Engross

![Engross](/Engross-1024x696.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Customizable Pomodoro timer

👎 Weakest aspect: Lack of advanced features

🏳️ Entry-level plan: Free to use

💌 Rating: 4.6

There are quite a few apps with the Pomodoro technique timer on the market. We
included this one on our list for its ease of use, combined with high
efficiency. The well-known Pomodoro technique suggests that you should break
down your workload into several sessions, each one around 25-30 minutes long. To
increase your productivity, you must take a break for a couple of minutes in
between each two sessions. Such an approach allows you to stay concentrated on
your tasks and minimize distractions. Engross lets you customize the duration of
your working sessions and the intervals between them. Besides, you can click the
dedicated button each time you get distracted. Based on the accumulated
statistics, you'll be able to see how much time you lose per day on distractions
and find ways to reduce it.

Engross is entirely focused on the Pomodoro technique and lacks other advanced
features. Some people perceive it as its drawback – and others as its key
competitive edge.

## MindMeister

![MindMeister](/MindMeister-1024x579.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Opportunity to create mind maps

👎 Weakest aspect: Not too intuitive interface

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $4.99

💌 Rating: 4.6

This one was designed to let you work with mind maps. They come in handy for
brainstorming, planning projects, and visualizing various sorts of data.
MindMeister is equally suitable for private individuals and business teams. It
lets you pick from ready-to-use map themes and customize them. All the
information that you input there will be safely stored in a cloud – which means
you'll be able to access your data from any location.

MindMeister might seem not too intuitive to some users. Nevertheless, it's one
of the top solutions in its niche.

## Hootsuite

![Hootsuite](/Hootsuite-1024x580.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Opportunity to plan, post, and analyze social network
content

👎 Weakest aspect: Steep learning curve

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $29

💌 Rating: 4.5

It became the trailblazer for planning and analyzing the content for social
networks. From one dashboard, you can schedule posts for multiple platforms and
monitor their performance. You'll be able to connect to your clients, reply to
their questions, share third-party content, filter incoming messages based on
priority, assign customer inquiries to specific team members, and perform many
other functions.

Such versatility comes at a cost – the learning curve of Hootsuite is rather
steep.

## FacileThings

![FacileThings](/FacileThings.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Adherence to the Getting Things Done methodology

👎 Weakest aspect: Not too intuitive UX/UI

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $12

💌 Rating: 4.5

It's a firm favorite of the adherents of the Getting Things Done (GDT)
methodology. GDT features five steps that let people better control their daily
lives. Thanks to avoiding stress and anxiety, you should be able to complete
more tasks. Plus, you won't feel emotionally and mentally overloaded. If you
have never tried GDT, it should be comfortable for you to master it from scratch
in the app. The built-in guide is genuinely helpful. If you use third-party
solutions to manage your tasks and data, you'll be able to integrate many of
them with FacileThings.

That said, the app has a disadvantage. Its UX/UI is not too intuitive.

## WebWork Time Tracker

![WebWork Time Tracker](/WebWork-Time-Tracker.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Employee monitoring opportunities

👎 Weakest aspect: Limited integrations

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $4.99

💌 Rating: 4.5

This app allows managers to monitor the efficiency of employees. You'll be able
to see how much time they spend on various websites and apps while they're
supposed to work. You can check how many platforms they visited and how many
mouse clicks they made. When you detect that someone is non-productive, you can
send them a pop-up message. The app collects statistics which enables you to
tell genuinely useful digital tools from their opposites. Plus, you can monitor
the usage of resources to make sure it's rational. Based on the obtained data,
you'll be able to edit schedules and reassign tasks.

On the flip side, WebWork Time Tracker's integrations with third-party solutions
are limited.

## TMetric

![TMetric](/TMetric.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Ability to calculate work hours

👎 Weakest aspect: Desktop version leaves to be desired

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $5

💌 Rating: 4.5

Managers rely on this product to authorize vacations, PTOs, and sick days. It
enables them to control the attendance of both remote and office staff members.
Outside of your workplace, you can use the app to better manage your time and
separate your private life from professional. If needed, you'll be able to sync
several calendars and track your budget. The onboarding process is intuitive and
the functionality is well thought out. The app can work both online and offline.

The only reason to criticize TMetric is that its desktop version leaves to be
desired.

## Due

![Due](/due.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Customizable reminders

👎 Weakest aspect: High price

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $6.99

💌 Rating: 4.5

As its name suggests, this app can inform you about the due date of your tasks
and events. It lets you set reminders and customize them. It's a genuinely
simple product that comes as a lifesaver for absent-minded individuals. The
reminders are highly flexible. You can react to them without even opening the
app. You may make the reminder repetitive until you complete the task. Besides,
you can snooze the reminder or reschedule it.

Due is powerful and flexible. However, it's focused exclusively on reminders and
lacks other features. That's why its price seems too high for some users.

## Everhour

![Everhour](/Everhour.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Convenient time tracking for teams

👎 Weakest aspect: Substandard iOS version

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $8.50

💌 Rating: 4.5

While there are dozens of time-tracking apps to choose from, this one stands out
from the rest. Its features were hand-picked to satisfy the demands of business
teams. Everhour integrates with various third-party solutions for managing your
tasks, projects, and budget. It generates comprehensive reports to help you stay
efficient. It has built-in invoicing tools and visual planning features.

On the flip side, the iOS version of its app is not too perfect.

## LastPass

![LastPass](/LastPass-1024x617.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Convenience of managing all your passwords in one place

👎 Weakest aspect: Security issues

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $3

💌 Rating: 4.4

Technically, it's not an app but a browser extension. It safely stores all your
passwords in one place. Thanks to this solution, you won't need to type in
manually your password for each website or app that you want to sign into.
You'll be able to access your collection of passwords from many different
devices and manage it as you wish.

Some might say that LastPass is not 100% secure. There were cases when it was
hacked. However, is there a digital solution that can't ever be hacked? The team
behind the extension keeps continuously working on boosting its security level.

## Hypercontext

![Hypercontext](/Hypercontext-1024x679.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Ease of conducting team meetings

👎 Weakest aspect: Lack of performance metrics for private individuals

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $7

💌 Rating: 4.4

This app generates demand among business teams who strive to streamline their
goals, morale, and meetings. You can use it to create collaborative meeting
agendas, track goals, make decisions on documents, and exchange feedback. It
will be easy for you to hold your team members accountable. If you struggle to
begin the conversation, the app can suggest hundreds of starters to you. Plus,
the built-in AI will be ready to help you with many other aspects of your work
in the app.

This otherwise excellent product has one drawback. Its performance metrics are
very much business-oriented. You might fail to benefit from them if you use this
app as a private individual.

## TroopMessenger

![TroopMessenger](/TroopMessenger-1024x655.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Simplified business communications

👎 Weakest aspect: Limited scalability

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $2.5

💌 Rating: 4.4

This one facilitates business communications. Unlike a conventional messenger,
it boasts many built-in features that enable its users to work faster and more
productively. For instance, when you send a file to your colleague through
WhatsApp, the document remains in a specific folder on your computer – and the
recipient downloads it to another folder on their device. TroopMessenger has a
centralized repository for all the files that you send through 1:1 or group
chats. Any member of the chat can effortlessly access them. It's much easier to
search for the necessary messages and people in this app with the help of the
filters.

Some users report that TroopMessenger becomes less efficient when your team
becomes too large or your projects become too complex. However, others don't
complain about that.

## Scribe

![Scribe](/Scribe.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Automated process of composing documentation

👎 Weakest aspect: Overwhelming details

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $23

💌 Rating: 4.4

This Google Extension is indispensable for composing documentation – or, to put
it simply, step-by-step how-tos. It can create a comprehensive guide for any
digital solution that you use. Launch the app, click Record in Scribe, and keep
on working in the app as usual. The documentation will contain every step that
you complete. It will consist not only of text but of screenshots too – the
latter will be made each time you click your mouse. You'll be able to embed the
ready guide into your knowledge base or CMS as well as send it to somebody as a
link. Such an approach enables you to standardize knowledge within your
organization. It becomes much easier to explain processes to people. Scribe can
save many hours of work for professionals who previously used to compose the
documentation manually. The saved time includes not only the hours spent on the
work – but also the days of training.

As for the disadvantages, Scribe pays thorough attention to every single detail.
Some users find it excessive.

## Apploye

![Apploye](/Apploye-1024x517.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Multitude of productivity tools

👎 Weakest aspect: Reports could have been more detailed

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $4

💌 Rating: 4.4

This one was conceived for managers who want their employees to spend nearly
100% of their time on useful activities. Apploye can remotely monitor the
performance of each specialist, taking up to three screenshots within ten
minutes. It can accurately assess the time that each person spends on various
apps as well as analyze their online habits. The dashboard can display neutral
vs. active time and compare the behavior of different staff members. The app is
packed with helpful features, including the Pomodoro timer and the Idle time
tracker.

What makes it imperfect are the reports that could have been more detailed.

## Fellow

![Fellow](/Fellow-1.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Well-structured online meetings

👎 Weakest aspect: Limited formatting opportunities

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $5

💌 Rating: 4.4

The two key ingredients of a successful online meeting are a clearly defined
goal and a structured agenda. Besides, every participant should be able to take
notes conveniently and share them with others. This is exactly what Fellow
brings to the table. You'll be able to track action items, assign tasks to your
group members, follow up, and fulfill other useful functions. Your virtual
meetings are supposed to become more productive.

Unfortunately, the formatting abilities of the app remain limited so far.

## Scalefusion

![Scalefusion](/Scalefusion-1024x587.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Robust mobile device management opportunities

👎 Weakest aspect: Occasional connectivity issues

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $2

💌 Rating: 4.4

More and more employees work remotely or in the hybrid format today. System
admins of their companies need to manage their mobile devices remotely to ensure
a high security level and smooth work. Scalefusion is one of the apps that helps
admins do their job. It enables professionals to remain productive regardless of
their current location and boost the overall performance of the whole
organization. It facilitates remote troubleshooting and integrates with some of
the most popular third-party office solutions.

With some users, this app works without a hitch. Others report occasional
connectivity issues.

## Clockify

![Clockify](/Clockify-1024x531.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Robust time-tracking

👎 Weakest aspect: Limited reporting capabilities

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $3.99

💌 Rating: 4.3

This one was created to let you manage your time and tasks. You'll be able to
review your plans in the calendar format and split your workload into blocks,
each of which consists of 5 to 60 minutes. The app lets you edit these blocks
and add extra hours to your schedule. You'll be able to track the time that you
devote to each task, detect what distracts you, and concentrate on
higher-priority issues. This solution supports collaboration. You can distribute
to-dos within a group, track attendance, and control your budget.

As for the drawbacks, the reporting capabilities of Clockify are limited.

## Krisp

![Krisp](/Krisp-1024x713.webp)

👍 Strongest aspect: Noise cancellation

👎 Weakest aspect: Tends to be technically demanding

🏳️ Entry-level plan: $5

💌 Rating: 4.3

Background noise is inevitable if you share your physical workspace with other
people. When you have audio or video calls, interfering sounds might distract
you. They can make you feel tired prematurely. You might need to waste time
asking your interlocutor to repeat their answer. In such circumstances, Krisp
can save you. It's an AI-powered solution that eliminates extra noises during
the conversation in real-time. It's compatible with hundreds of apps and
devices, including microphones, speakers, and headphones.

On the flip side, Krisp might fail to work with some old apps or rare operating
systems. It consumes a lot of memory and needs stable online connectivity.

## Final Thoughts

There are dozens of good productivity apps on the market. They enable you to
make the most of your efforts while completing tasks and projects. They
eliminate obstacles that might hinder you, facilitate communication and
collaboration, and perform other helpful functions.

One of the biggest hits in this niche is called LeaderTask. It's a powerful task
management solution, compatible with all platforms and operating systems. It
lets you structure your workload and manage your to-dos effortlessly.
