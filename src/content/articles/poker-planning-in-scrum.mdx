Planning and systematic task discussions are essential components of teamwork
within any project. When a team consists of two or three individuals, reaching
an agreement on disputed matters is relatively straightforward. However, as the
workgroup expands to 10, 20, or more members, opinions often diverge. Team
members involved in software product development may assess the effort required
for assigned tasks and their complexity differently. Poker Planning comes to the
rescue in finding a 'common denominator'. It's a Scrum technique aimed at
collaboratively resolving various tasks during the software product creation
process.

Planning poker is a technique for assessing the complexity of tasks performed by
a team. It was developed by James Grenning, one of the authors of the Agile
Manifesto. Further development and popularization of the methodology were
facilitated by Mike Cohn, who described it in his work 'Agile Estimating and
Planning.'

Planning poker helps to precisely assess the volume and complexity of tasks. All
team members, including developers, testers, engineers, designers, analysts, and
other project contributors, are involved in the estimation process. Team-based
estimation yields an objective result. For instance, a developer might know how
much time a task takes but could exaggerate its complexity to secure more time.
Therefore, estimation results are always overseen by a manager who acts as a
facilitator. No participants know each other's opinions until the polling is
complete. Their opinions are voiced simultaneously.

In Scrum, planning poker works as follows:

- Each participant receives a set of cards with number points or alternative
  symbols. Typically, this involves numbers from the Fibonacci sequence or
  various icons. For example, a 'question mark' signifies uncertainty, while a
  coffee cup or beer glass implies a need for a break in the discussion.

- Regardless of the symbols used, the smallest number is assigned to simple
  tasks. 0 represents the simplest task that should not be included in the plan.
  1-3 denotes easy tasks, 5-13 signifies moderate complexity, 20-40 represents
  larger tasks, and 100 marks significant, large-scale tasks. Tasks labeled with
  the infinity symbol are considered epic in importance and scale.

- The client or product manager reads out the task. This is important to avoid
  the 'broken telephone' effect, where distorted information is passed from one
  participant to another.

- Participants are given time to contemplate. Then, they choose a card that
  corresponds to the task's complexity and importance and place it face down on
  the table.

- Cards are revealed simultaneously. If there are significant differences in
  opinions, they are discussed with arguments presented for various solutions.
  If a participant estimates the task as the simplest, they should explain how
  they intend to complete it so quickly. Performers who assign the maximum
  scores to a task also provide reasons why they consider it so complex.

- An additional round of estimation is conducted. Based on the data collected, a
  final decision is made.

Before starting with the cards, the methodology for estimation is determined.
You must decide whether you will assess the task's complexity or the amount of
time required for its completion?

| Time          | It is estimated how much time is needed to solve the problem.                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Story Points  | The complexity of the backlog products is evaluated.                            |
| T-shirt sizes | For task estimation, conditional 't-shirt sizes' are used: XS, S, M, L, and XL. |

In practice, it looks something like this:

- So, we have a task in front of us. How much time is needed for its completion?

- The participants of the game silently contemplate on what estimation to give
  to the task given by the client.

- Cards are revealed. Why do the opinions of participants A and B drastically
  differ from participant C? We discuss the issue!

- Cards are laid out again. An estimation for the task is given, taking into
  account the previous discussion. A collective decision is reached.

**Advantages of the technique:**

- All team members are involved in the estimation process.

- A consistent understanding of the task is formed within the working group
  through experience exchange among project participants.

- It helps to achieve consensus in determining task complexity.

- It eliminates the 'anchoring effect.' If one or more participants vocally
  state a specific time frame for task completion ('I think it will take 6
  days'), other performers unconsciously anchor to that number. That is, if
  someone determined for themselves that they can complete the task in 3 days,
  they will subconsciously inflate their estimation.

Use Cases of Planning Poker:

This technique is used in the development of software products within Scrum
teams operating under an Agile methodology. The primary goal of Planning Poker
is not to pinpoint an exact deadline for task completion, but to ensure that all
team members understand the execution process equally accurately. The method is
suitable for teams and tasks that have sufficient time to achieve consensus on
disputed matters.

To make the technique more useful for the team, the following rules can be
applied:

- Discussions should be productive. To avoid dragging them out, a two-minute
  timer is set. When it goes off, the right to speak moves to the next team
  member. This encourages everyone to express themselves concisely.

- Break discussions into smaller sessions. Large groups can also be divided into
  smaller subgroups. When remote team members are involved, Skype conferences
  with project management tools are used.

- As most managers strive for quicker completion, their voting can often be
  inefficient. However, they are more experienced compared to ordinary team
  members. If the estimation difference is insignificant, choose the larger one.
  In some cases, managers are given veto power over the team's consensus.

- Participants participating in the poll should have an understanding of task
  complexity based on past practical experience.

- All estimates must be provided synchronously! Otherwise, participants will
  base their estimations on each other, minimizing planning objectivity. Set a
  timer on your phone or use a loud alarm.

- Do not disregard the 'break' card. Some people need time to rest.

- Hold meetings regularly, such as every two weeks or every other day, depending
  on the sprint duration. This helps keep all important tasks under control. If
  more time is needed for their completion, they are brought up for discussion
  again.

**Application of LeaderTask for Project Management:**

The Planning Poker technique is suitable for efficiently interacting teams.
Different services and programs are used to organize communications between
their participants and provide remote management for Scrum-method teams. One of
these services is the LeaderTask application, which combines task manager,
organizer, planner, and modern project management system functions.

This service replaces several popular planning applications, including Todoist
or Trello. It helps efficiently allocate tasks among performers, plan the time
for their completion, track the final result and effectiveness of each project
participant. The application supports all the necessary functionality of
flexible Agile methodologies, including electronic Kanban boards for a visual
representation of tasks in the Scrum system.

The program includes a convenient chat for discussing current project matters.
It can be used for messaging, exchanging voice messages, and commenting on
attached documents. LeaderTask operates on all digital platforms, functions
offline without an internet connection. It helps expedite task completion and
team projects.

## **Conclusion**

Planning Poker is based on chance, transforming the routine process of setting
task deadlines into an engaging showdown among team members. It helps establish
realistic deadlines and fosters a shared understanding of project complexity.
Through the estimation process, the team finds the best solution for the task
that is as close to implementation as possible. This method is best suited for
agile teams implementing Scrum in its entirety.
