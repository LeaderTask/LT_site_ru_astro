All processes, goals, concepts and objects begin with ideas, which are then
communicated to other people, discussed, developed, produced. And only then are
they put into the public eye, where they are used by people en masse.

Project management in a manager's activity is no exception. It too must start
somewhere. And in most cases, the first stage of a future endeavor consists of
building a roadmap and forming a project plan. But what does it consist of?

In this article, we will try to give recommendations and explain in detail how
to properly create such a plan, why you need planning, what algorithms and
strategies exist for its creation, what project planning processes you need to
go through, how to bring it to completion and what instructions or tools in this
matter serve as the main helpers.

## What is project planning

Planning itself is a step-by-step process of creating and adopting a system of
targets and identifying ways to achieve them in the most fruitful and
expeditious way. These objectives often look like a tree of goals and describe
the future.

Its practical importance is due to a number of reasons, the most important of
which are the uncertainty of the future, the coordinating role of the plan and
the optimization of economic outcomes. Planning maximizes the probability and
level of achievement of objectives, based on systematic preparation of
decisions.

The main technique for introducing participants to a project before work begins
is its plan. Creation and further adoption of the plan by the whole working
group, including the supervisor and manager, helps to better understand personal
responsibility and own tasks.

## What is a project plan

A coherent project plan is not a list of mechanical tasks for staff and project
team members, but organization and control. The project plan shows the key
themes, project objectives, the order of steps, possible difficulties and how to
overcome them in the course of the activity.

During planning, the manager performs an assessment, determines the primary
goals, the team of performers, contractors and distribution of tasks, and works
out a schedule for accomplishing the tasks. The manager should realize that the
plan will be adjusted and supplemented in the course of the activity.

Thus, the plan is created to streamline the future work of the project team and
minimize risks, prescribe the responsibilities of each team member, ease of
control and avoid unnecessary fuss.

## Why create a plan

The need to create a plan is that it solves and covers several important tasks
at once. Without it, it is unlikely to achieve much and overcome possible
difficulties that will be encountered on the way to the realization of the
project.

First, at the planning stage, the project itself is approved and agreed upon
with the main members of the working group. Secondly, management procedures are
created and refined, goals and objectives are detailed, scope of work, control
points and qualitative composition of activities are established.

In addition, at the planning stage, the order of future interaction in the team
is specified, possible risks are assessed and methods of solving and combating
them are evaluated, the need for resources and the possibility of obtaining them
are clarified, the budget and the actual schedule of work are developed.

## Basics of project planning

The process of making a plan that includes all the stages of creating and
executing a project is called project planning. The introduction stage starts
with conceptualization by the project manager. Then a strategy is selected for
it, details are specified.

A presentation or lecture about the project and its methods is made to
investors, top managers, executives and heads of the firm. Participants for the
working group are selected and contracts are signed. After that, direct work is
performed and the project is safely completed.

In addition, the planning phase outlines the key characteristics of the
implementation of the agreed process. These typically include the following
components:

- duration of all monitored elements of the project activity;

- resource requirements (e.g., labor, financial, material and technical);

- calendar dates and place of delivery of mandatory equipment, component parts,
  raw materials, supplies, etc;

- the format for engaging contractors and third-party organizations.

Project planning is a key process that directly affects the outcome of the
entire team. Therefore, all stages of planning should be a guarantee that the
process will be carried out within the set timeframe and in compliance with the
requirements (cost, standards, quality). And its execution should be the
responsibility of the specific persons assigned to the positions.

The essence of planning consists of several main and auxiliary processes.
However, the former are always present. These include:

- logging, describing the contents of the plan;

- formulation of basic stages of project implementation, decomposition,
  establishment of smaller components (subtasks, subprojects);

- developing an estimate and estimating the cost of the resource component
  required for implementation;

- drawing up a calendar cycle of works;

- evaluation and planning of resources (labor, time, material, etc.);

- budgeting;

- Identification of risks, constraints, critical barriers during the execution
  of work;

- collecting results of other planning processes, compiling them into a single
  documentation;

- developing a step-by-step plan that guarantees results and a successful
  completion of the work activity.

Auxiliary processes, unlike core processes, may not exist or may be included in
planning as needed. They most often include design, justification and setting of
quality standards, selection of people, distribution of functions,
responsibilities and subordination, logistics and many others.

The planning results include all necessary data, differentiated by levels,
timeframes, models, phases, etc. They are built according to the principles of
"feedback", provide regular comparison of planned and actual information, and
make activities more efficient and flexible.

## What are the strategies and methods of project planning

In project plan, several factors should be considered while structuring the
work, which include the duration of the work, direct profit from the finished
project, indirect profit or saving of resources, number of costs, cost of delays
and the possibility of benefiting from the product under development until the
very end of the project activity.

Depending on the combination of all these factors, one of two methodological
strategies for plan formulation should be chosen. These options include:

1. All resources of the business are directed to the sequence of work, creation
   and realization of one, but large and profitable project with the purpose of
   its operative execution.

2. The Company is engaged in simultaneous and continuous development of several
   projects of equal importance and dedicated resources.

At the same time, the first sample of strategy implies a high level of
interaction between all participants, constant mutual assistance. And the lack
of timely support from colleagues significantly reduces the level of motivation
of the performer, at the same time greatly reducing the speed of implementation.

## How to write a project plan: a step-by-step guide

So, let's start creating a calendar schedule using the template. It will allow
the supervisor, manager, and workgroup members to remain confident that all
project details are maximally worked out, each stage is ready, and there is
nothing to worry about.

### 1\. Present the plan in the form of a project map

This is a very important section for the whole planning process, because before
the plan is directly drawn up, a route map should be drawn up to answer the
following questions:

- the significance of the project;

- who will be in charge of its implementation;

- what control points it will contain, what is the approximate distance between
  them, timing;

- what obstacles, what barriers might be encountered along the way;

- what alternative solutions are envisioned;

- how to realize that a project is complete.

It is not necessary to outline the whole project map in as much detail as
possible. However, it should give a general idea of where to go and how to make
a plan.

### 2\. Draw up a schedule of works

Excessive optimism in project planning is unacceptable. It is recommended to
carefully study possible problems that may arise in the future and their impact
on the schedule. Talk to managers and employees who have already been involved
in similar projects and ask them for approximate deadlines.

### 3\. Get to know the participants

The main helpers in achieving a goal are the people with whom the manager has to
work long and hard. Therefore, one of the first steps on the way to the best
possible project planning, execution and completion is communication with
employees.

The staff should be introduced beforehand, then introduced to each other, then
discuss the organization of the process and working points together. The manager
can sometimes act as a teacher and the employee as a student. In this way, the
manager as if instructs and guides the team, gives clear tasks to achieve
results. It is important to assess the needs and expectations of the team, to
get feedback. In the future, this will avoid possible misunderstandings between
colleagues and will help to maintain a favorable working atmosphere in the team.

### 4\. Involve assistants

You should not close yourself in your office and put all the burden of
pre-planning on yourself. When developing a project, it is important to involve
all stakeholders, future participants, and the project manager. Working together
allows you to create a more effective plan, mobilize forces to support parts of
the project.

### 5\. Identify the main objectives

A clear idea of the necessity and importance of the project and the need to
invest in it will help the team, partners, investors, and the manager to be sure
that the idea is worthy of attention. Then no one will have any doubts that the
realization will bring benefits, profit and general satisfaction.

### 6\. Determine the scope of work

It is also important to outline a series of tasks with the duration of each of
them. This will help to understand how much time will be required for the
further implementation of the project as a whole, and thus avoid subsequent
misunderstandings, dissatisfied questions from the management and unnecessary
costs.

### 7\. Define roles and responsibilities, assign resources

Then it is necessary to outline the equipment, funding and logistics that will
be needed to achieve the goal. Make a memo and indicate the number of personnel,
necessary specialists. Describe in detail the responsible executors, research
staff of the project, accountable persons, consultants and other staff members
who are informed about the actions taken and decisions made.

It is very important to take into account the skills and abilities of the
individuals in the working group. It is important to have a clear understanding
of who can be assigned certain responsibilities and whose participation in the
team is better left out.

### 8\. Assess the risks

In the course of project implementation, various emergencies and force majeure
situations may arise. These usually include additional costs, urgent business
trips, illness or dismissal of one or more employees, outsourcing, or failure to
meet deadlines for specific tasks. They should also be foreseen in advance,
analyzed, discussed with the team and outlined possible solutions.

### 9\. Write and check the plan

After extensive preparatory work, discussions, and a pile of post-its and
papers, you should immediately start writing the plan. Its structure should
contain the main points: title, deadline, budget, goals, control points,
executors, details of tasks, clarifying remarks, possible risks and methods of
their prevention. When writing the plan, don't be afraid to come up with and
exercise your independent creativity.

The simpler the project sounds on paper, the better. The simpler the project
sounds on paper, the better. Do not forget to check the plan thoroughly before
handing it in. If necessary, you can let uninterested people read it.

### 10\. Share the plan and launch the project

The last point is to show the plan to the participants of the future working
group, the manager, investors and other stakeholders. If some points remain
unclear to them, then correct or add them to the paper. If the plan satisfies
the colleagues, then start the agreed project and do not be afraid of possible
difficulties. The main thing is to focus on the case, adhere to the plan and
methodically go to the goal.

## LeaderTask platform for project plan creation

![Best Planner Apps for Android](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

A specialized program for project planning will not allow you to miss important
details in large goals and will close all the tasks set by the manager in a
timely manner. This is why most domestic companies are increasingly resorting to
the help of the LeaderTask online platform.

The service provides the team with the ability to create and plan daily
schedules and task lists, write notes, set standard and regular reminders,
create common and personal individual projects, add participants to them, and
receive edits from the manager in the corporate online chat.

In addition, LeaderTask allows you to highlight the main points that cannot be
missed, with the help of colored labels, "In Focus" function, and task status.
The service is easy to manage, delegate tasks, discuss projects, send files and
documents, add notes and checklists.

Software synchronization makes it possible to manage projects from any networked
device. At the same time, busy managers can apply voice input of tasks. Thanks
to this software functionality, employees can capture important information in a
short period of time, maintain discipline and work as productively as possible.

Free test period for paid tariffs - from 3 days (by agreement with the
developer). The program features can be taught independently with the help of
many training materials. Special conditions are provided for educational and
training institutions and non-profit organizations.

No manager can work effectively without planning. A predetermined and detailed
schedule makes the activities of a team, department or work group coherent,
successful and helps to finish the project within the agreed timeframe.

Remote work, multi-project work and participation in international organizations
require even more careful and detailed planning and management processes from
employees. In this case, a detailed plan created on the automated LeaderTask
platform is an excellent solution.

The program allows you to simultaneously communicate business goals to the
manager, partners, subordinates, and visually displays work processes in real
time, and informs all project participants about changes and revisions, allows
you to conduct a study of work processes for their further development.
