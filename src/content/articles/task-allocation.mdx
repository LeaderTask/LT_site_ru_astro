Optimal distribution of tasks, control of their solution and subsequent
evaluation of personnel efficiency are mandatory actions that must be performed
by the head of a company, regardless of its scale and type of activity. Modern
developments - scheduling software - can be reliable helpers in organising the
work process.

## Efficient distribution of tasks

The main means by which a manager allocates and co-ordinates tasks is
delegation. It means assigning certain tasks to a specific person or work group
who takes responsibility for their fulfilment.

In order to achieve effective delegation, it is important to ensure that the
tasks are in line with the actual authority of the staff. This rule applies to
both one-time and recurring tasks. Authorisation means a set of rights to use
the resources of the enterprise and to manage certain employees in order to
achieve the set goals.

## Proper distribution of tasks

Three important conditions:

1. Assigning tasks to employees, taking into account their knowledge,
   qualifications and work experience;

2. The executor has the appropriate authority;

3. Clearly identifying the supervisor to whom the employee/group has
   personal/group responsibility.

## Task allocation system task allocation system

In companies and organisations, the most common ways of distributing tasks
between subordinates - "herringbone" and "matryoshka" - are used in practice.

The peculiarities of the first system are such that the rights and
responsibilities of the manager cover only a small part of the rights and
responsibilities of the executor located at a lower level. The advantages of
such a system are high clarity and easy detection of the executor (responsible
person). The disadvantage is the top-down distribution of tasks against the
background of the fact that the company's goals are mainly achieved
horizontally. As a result, contradictions often arise, and a lot of time is
spent on overcoming them.

The specificity of the matryoshka doll system consists in a different approach
to subordination. In this case it has a double or multiple character. In this
case, the rights and responsibilities of the superior management completely
absorb the rights and responsibilities of the subordinates. This approach has a
significant disadvantage: it is very difficult to find the culprit of a business
failure.

What conclusion can be drawn? The efficiency of task allocation is achieved only
when a horizontal hierarchy is built. This is taken into account by modern
scheduling programmes. They are characterised by a tree-like structure, allow
for the correct distribution of tasks among employees, taking into account their
job responsibilities and real professional capabilities, as well as to ensure
control over the implementation of tasks.
