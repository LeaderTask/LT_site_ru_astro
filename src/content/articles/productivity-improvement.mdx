Have you ever thought about how much time you spend on work? How quickly do you
complete assigned tasks? Do you always meet deadlines? If you find yourself
constantly busy throughout the day but still unable to accomplish much, it's
worth considering ways to increase productivity.

To achieve success in business, it's not enough to manage your personal and work
time effectively. You need to be able to focus on tasks, manage your potential
and energy. Productivity is not an accidental achievement. It is the result of
constant self-improvement, development, and purposeful allocation of efforts.

This term originated in economics from agriculture, where it meant fertility or
the ability to select the best specimens of animals or plants for subsequent
breeding. Later, the concept of productivity began to be used to describe
creative professions. In this case, it denoted the ability to create material
goods or perform certain actions within a limited time.

How will increased productivity make life more successful and efficient? Let's
try to understand these questions through practical examples.

## Tips for increasing productivity

According to Chris Bailey, the author of the bestseller "The Productivity
Project" and an expert in time management, productivity consists of three main
components: energy, attention, and time. If you have a lot of energy but spend
it on secondary tasks, dispersing your attention on minor details, you won't be
able to accomplish the most important things. Without the ability to concentrate
and focus on essential tasks, you won't be able to realize your potential and
energy in your work. And without effective energy allocation, you'll simply run
out of the energy needed to complete all your planned tasks.

## 15 Ways to Increase Productivity

We have gathered effective methods to increase productivity that will help you
wisely manage your time, capabilities, and energy. We invite you to explore them
in more detail in the following compilation

## 1\. Set goals correctly

To achieve a goal, it needs to be formulated correctly. Every minute spent on
planning can save up to 10 minutes of your time. Learning to plan properly will
make you more focused, help you concentrate better, and enable you to reach your
desired results faster.

When setting goals, remember that they should be realistic and achievable, with
specific deadlines.

## 2\. Focus on the Main Things

To organize your work time, use the GTD system. It involves recording all tasks
and constantly updating them. This way, all your tasks will always be in front
of you, and you can control their execution.

To focus on the main things, it's convenient to use the MIT (Most Important
Task) strategy. It works as follows:

- When creating your daily to-do list, write down the most important goal at the
  top.

- Next, in the list, assign numbers from 1 to 5 and add current tasks that will
  contribute to achieving the main goal.

- Complete the tasks in order of their importance.

To properly prioritize your daily tasks, you can use the Eisenhower Matrix.
According to this method, all tasks are divided into four groups:

1. Important and urgent tasks.

2. Important but not urgent tasks.

3. Not important but urgent tasks.

4. Not important and not urgent tasks.

| **IMPORTANT**     | 1\. **Do:** We do it without delay, execute it immediately. | 2\. **Plan:** We find a suitable time for execution.                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NOT IMPORTANT** | 3\. **Delegate:** We delegate the task to employees.        | 4\. **Decline:** We refuse to execute it, not wasting time on meaningless tasks. |
|                   | **URGENT**                                                  | **NOT URGENT**                                                                   |

Filling out the matrix will allow you to visually see what to do first and what
to completely avoid.

## 3\. **Use the "Rule of Three"**

You don't need to fill your day with complex and serious tasks. With such a
hectic pace, you risk burning out quickly. During the day, identify the three
most important tasks that need to be completed by its end. Alternate between
challenging tasks and simpler ones. This way, you protect yourself and your
brain from overload and complete your work more efficiently. You can plan your
tasks for each week using the same principle.

## 4\. **Filter Out the Excess**

When starting secondary tasks, ask yourself how important they are to the final
result and the team's success. Does their completion fall within your
competence? Only then proceed to solve the assigned task. This procedure is
effective for employees who are used to shifting their tasks and
responsibilities onto others.

## 5\. **Set Deadlines for Yourself**

If you have a habit of postponing assignments "for later," which forces you to
rush to complete everything by the end of the day, set deadlines for their
completion in advance. For example, you need to submit several reports by
Friday. To avoid missing the deadline, set the deadline for one of them on
Wednesday. However, it's essential not to overdo it with deadlines. Monitoring
notifications about impending work deadlines daily can turn you into a nervy
individual who feels like they can't keep up. In other words, this "urge to
work" can be a source of additional stress. To avoid overstrain and nervous
exhaustion, set deadlines considering the complexity of the task at hand and
your capabilities.

## 6\. Allocate time for relaxation.

![Productivity improvement](/otdyh-1-1024x556.webp)

When discussing productivity enhancement methods, one cannot ignore the topic of
rest. Even in the busiest schedule, it is worth allocating time for personal
activities. Don't wait for a day to become freer someday. If you want to read an
interesting book, find time for this enjoyable activity. If you are passionate
about painting, allocate a couple of hours to your favorite hobby every day.
Changing activities, as well as taking breaks, will help you relax and gather
strength to tackle serious and important tasks.

## 7\. **Do not clutter your mind with household problems.**

Unresolved household problems can greatly distract from the work process,
preventing you from focusing on your goals. To avoid thinking in the morning
about what to wear to the office, prepare your outfits in advance. Allocate time
in your schedule for household chores and cleaning. Plan a trip to the store by
making a shopping list in advance, and plan the family's menu for the week. By
handling domestic tasks in advance, you will be able to concentrate better on
your work.

## 8\. **Do not procrastinate the completion of unpleasant tasks "until the last minute".**

You have an important call to make to a client or need to approach your
supervisor for clarification on a task, but you hesitate to do so? Don't delay
it. Psychologically challenging tasks should be done quickly, without
hesitation. This will help save energy and nerves that would otherwise be spent
on worrying about an unresolved problem.

The sooner you deal with unpleasant tasks, the sooner you will feel calm and
return to your main work.

## 9\. **Use your own 'biological rhythms.'**

Each person operates on their own biological rhythms. By intelligently using
your 'biological clock,' you can become more productive and successful in life.
Listen to your body. When planning your work time, schedule the most important
tasks during your peak hours when you are more active. If you are more energetic
in the first half of the day, dedicate that time to activities that require
intense mental effort.

To accurately determine your 'active hours,' it is necessary to keep a diary of
observations for several weeks, noting your level of concentration. Or you can
use a specialized productivity calculator.

## 10.Work with a suitable time management system.

![Productivity improvement](/budilnik-1024x342.webp)

No matter how organized and goal-oriented a person may be, they cannot work
continuously without weekends and breaks. Therefore, it is necessary to plan
your work time in advance so that you can take periodic breaks during the
workday. There are many methods for organizing work time. You can base it on an
academic hour, which lasts for 45 minutes, followed by a 15-minute break. Or you
can use the popular Pomodoro technique. Using this method, you should take a
5-minute break every 25 minutes of work.

## 11\. **Don't be afraid of mistakes in your work.**

One of the main obstacles to becoming more effective in work or life is the fear
of making mistakes. Often, doubting their abilities, people get stuck and do
nothing at all.

Mistakes are a natural part of any work. Therefore, you should approach them as
a kind of push for development. Failures should be evaluated, analyzed, and
studied to make the right conclusions for the future. With the right approach,
over time, you will realize that you can "turn" any mistakes to your advantage
by addressing gaps in your knowledge or professional skills.

## 12\. **Choose your circle of acquaintances wisely.**

If you want to become successful, surround yourself with successful people. Your
development largely depends on who you associate with. Spend time with
interesting, educated individuals. You will learn something new from them, and
you will be motivated to strive for their level. Join professional communities,
attend conferences, seminars, and other educational events. This way, you will
expand your network with intelligent and successful people.

Avoid communication with pessimists who constantly complain about life's
problems and difficulties. Depressive and panic states are contagious to those
around them. Do not hesitate to break off communication with "toxic" colleagues.
Maintain a positive attitude and self-confidence in any circumstances.

## 13\. **Downtime can also be productive.**

You can benefit from idleness and your own indecisiveness. It's true. According
to Austin Kleon, the author of the popular book "Steal Like an Artist," everyone
should have a few tasks on hand to work on when they "lack inspiration for
work." You can even prepare a list of such tasks in advance. But do not get
distracted by them at the expense of your main work.

## 14\. **Don't overdo it with messaging apps and social media.**

According to research by scientists at the University of London, constant phone
calls, sending text messages, and emails throughout the day can reduce a
person's IQ by 10%. The same effect is achieved with extreme fatigue if you
don't get a full night's sleep.

Communication can be a significant distraction from work. Therefore, when
tackling a serious task, it's essential to establish specific rules for handling
email. Limit visits to social media to three sessions: in the morning, at
lunchtime, and in the evening. You should also restrict the duration of
communication with colleagues on minor issues. In conversations, prioritize
genuinely important and serious matters.

## 15\. Use the LeaderTask electronic assistant.

"While exploring various ways to increase productivity, it's essential to
highlight the importance of process automation. Monitoring employee efficiency
is convenient with the help of a specialized scheduling software.

The LeaderTask electronic application helps assess the performance of each
employee, track their productivity, and competence. With the task manager, it's
easy to set goals for subordinates and keep information about clients.

You can track the progress of tasks on a visual graph. Points are assigned for
completed tasks, which are displayed in the 'Productivity' section. If you meet
deadlines, you receive an additional point for each completed assignment. If a
task deadline is at risk, you can discuss a deadline extension within the
built-in chat without leaving the task.

You can track productivity in the application based on various parameters:

- For all tasks being executed.

- For personal tasks assigned to you or assigned by you.

You can obtain information for specific periods:

- For the last 10 days.

- For the last 10 weeks.

- For the last 10 months.

The efficiency of each team member is displayed on a productivity scale, showing
your average performance compared to other employees. The formula used for
calculating productivity in the LeaderTask application is:

(Completed tasks on time / All completed tasks) \* 100

The LeaderTask application includes a productivity chart, which is a diagram
displaying three main indicators:

- The total number of completed tasks.

- The number of tasks completed on time.

- The total number of overdue tasks with negative marks.

The program synchronizes with all digital platforms, works in both online and
offline modes, and integrates with most popular services and applications. It
offers a free trial period and convenient pricing with expanded functionality."
