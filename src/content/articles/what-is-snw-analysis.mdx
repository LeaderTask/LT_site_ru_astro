SNW-analysis is used to determine the competitiveness of the enterprise, to
study its internal environment, to identify points of growth, to gain advantages
over competitors. To conduct it, the entire functionality of the company is
divided into separate blocks. Each of them is considered separately. This
technique is a more in-depth variation of the SWOT method used to analyze
strengths and weaknesses.

## What it is

![What it is SNW](/image-49.webp)

This is a way of assessing internal factors affecting the functioning of the
company. SNW-analysis assesses the state of its organizational structure, as
well as production, marketing, logistics services, and other areas. This
abbreviation consists of the English words Strength, Neutral, Weakness and is
deciphered as follows:

- S are the strengths of a company that can be seen in certain parts or areas of
  its business. These include: market share, product quality, competitive
  advantages.

- N are neutral values. These are stable moments. For example, structures and
  buildings owned by the company, its equipment, fixed assets. At the same time,
  the efficiency of use of each resource is assessed separately.

- W - weaknesses or vulnerabilities, existing, potential risks, problems of the
  company. In this segment it is important to identify weaknesses that have a
  direct impact on its condition. For example, if it turns out that the product
  is of low quality, it is necessary to deal with the quality of its raw
  materials.

All factors under study are assigned neutral market average values (N). Then
they are compared with real indicators, finding out how much they correspond to
the norm and how they differ from similar indicators of competitors. The study
is carried out to identify the positive aspects of the company's work, eliminate
the detected shortcomings and determine the average indicators that clearly
demonstrate the activities of the firm.

## What SNW analysis is for

This methodology is used to analyze the state of the organization in order to
improve its competitiveness. The study demonstrates the composition, hierarchy
of departments, shows what processes occur within the company, how they affect
its performance and development. Helps to assess the effectiveness of the
management system, marketing, production. It is the basis for strategic
planning.

SNV-analysis shows in which areas the company lags behind its competitors and to
what extent, in which positions it is ahead of them. On its basis, a further
development plan is built, which can be realized in two directions:

- The positives are further refined and scaled;

- Negative factors that inhibit its performance are identified and converted
  into neutral factors.

- Neutral positions are being reinforced.

To stay ahead of the competition, a company should have a neutral position in
most of the indicators studied and a few strong positions. This will allow it to
feel confident in its market niche.

Knowing the strengths of his company, the manager can use them to the greater
advantage of the business, and turn the shortcomings into advantages that
distinguish it among competitors.

For example: You launch a line of fashionable clothes made of quality materials.
Because of this, the cost of production is quite high, so you only have a few
models in your range.

Your disadvantages: high selling price and limited assortment. But, these same
indicators can be used in a positive aspect. Your clothes can be afforded by
people with a stable income. They are satisfied with its design, quality and
uniqueness, so they will buy things regularly. That means you will get a steady
income from sales.

## Advantages and disadvantages

SNW-analysis has the advantages of SWOT-methodology, but at the same time it
allows to study the object in more depth. Among the advantages of its
application it is worth highlighting:

1. Highlighting the winning aspects of the company's operations;

2. Obtaining recommendations to improve the company's operations;

3. Ability to qualitatively survey the internal and external environment of the
   company.

4. Evaluation of each division, department of the enterprise in figures.

5. The methodology is characterized by simplicity and is suitable for all
   business owners and managers. It does not require in-depth knowledge of
   business analytics.

There are disadvantages to the approach as well:

- It evaluates exclusively internal factors of the company, without taking into
  account the influences of the external environment.

- Market averages of internal indicators of other companies operating in the
  industry are not always accurate and reliable.

## Methodology and examples of SNW analysis

The technique is based on a qualitative assessment of the company's internal
environment. In such a study, for example, for salaries, it is not the size, but
the level: (W) - "below market", (T) - "average", (S) - above market. To conduct
SNW analysis, the following steps should be performed:

1. Identify factors to be evaluated.

2. Calculate market averages.

3. Evaluate the company on each factor.

4. Draw conclusions by making a list of recommendations.

### What is the object of SNW analysis

These are factors, parameters that directly or indirectly affect the company's
efficiency, revenue, and competitiveness. Special attention is paid to elements
that consume a lot of resources, as well as areas where mistakes are made,
difficulties in work arise. In the course of the analysis, the following aspects
of the company's activities are investigated:

- Business Strategy;

- Management System;

- Marketing, production level;Marketing, production level

- Quality of product, services, their competitiveness in the market;

- Fixed Assets;

- Finance;

- State of the Labor Force;

- Corporate Values.

These elements can be further divided into components. For example, when
studying labor resources, such indicators as personnel qualification, salary
level, and the company's talent pool are considered separately.

### Calculation of market averages

In the course of the SNV analysis, the company is compared with its competitors.
For this purpose, the necessary data is collected from public financial reports,
marketing research. Websites, advertising materials of competing companies, mass
media and other sources are also used to find information. Next, the average
market (neutral) values for all the factors under study are determined.

### How to work with the results of SNW analysis

All indicators of the enterprise are compared to neutral values. They are
assigned one of three levels: weak, neutral or strong.

After the study, the manager should have a clear picture of the company's
activities, with all possible advantages and disadvantages. On its basis,
conclusions are drawn, lists of recommendations are drawn up to eliminate
bottlenecks and strengthen the firm's strong positions. A goal is formulated,
deadlines are set, and specific measures are outlined to achieve the set
objectives.

Technically, an SNW analysis is a summary table of a similar type:

| Criteria investigated |                      | Analysis    |                |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
|                       | S (strong qualities) | N (neutral) | W (weaknesses) |
| Strategy              |                      |             |                |
| Management structure  |                      |             |                |
| Finance               |                      |             |                |
| Labor resources       |                      |             |                |
| Marketing             |                      |             |                |

The first column of the table lists all the factors that affect the
profitability of the organization, e.g.:

- Costs;

- Level of technical equipment;

- Investment Availability;

- Market Reputation;

- Operation of the distribution system, sales;

- Relations with government agencies, other indicators that can be researched
  and studied.

A detailed analysis of each position gives an opportunity to improve the
company's business processes and gain advantages over competitors. First of all,
"problem areas" are written down in the table with a precise indication of
deadlines for their correction:

| Criteria investigated         |                      | Analysis    |                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
|                               | S (strong qualities) | N (neutral) | W (weaknesses) |
| Quality, level of advertising | 20.10.2024           | ←           |                |
| Квалификация персонала        |                      | 10.11.2024  | ←              |

A comment column can also be added to the table, spelling out specific tips for
improving the situation.
