A timeline is a workflow visualization tool that helps you consistently break
down a project into stages and complete it on time. By placing tasks on a
timeline, it is visually easier to assess their duration, as well as to identify
interrelated tasks - those that cannot be started until the previous ones are
completed.

Tasks can be freely moved, their duration can be changed, deleted and new tasks
can be created. The timeline can be used for planning, evaluating performance
and finding critical points.

##### Price: 55 $.

Once purchased, the Timeline plugin will be available to all license users, both
current and future.

**Note**: The plug-in works only in the Web-version of LeaderTask. Web-plugin is
purchased separately from the license once and for all.
