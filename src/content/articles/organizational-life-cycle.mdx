  to apply the concept of organizational life cycle in practice

The life cycle of an organization is the set of stages that a company goes
through from inception to closure, to death. Although different firms have
different lifespans, the trajectory of their lives is predictable. We can make a
development plan that any organization will follow.

The concept of the life cycle compares businesses to living things. Like any
organism, companies are born, mature, grow, develop, then age - decline - and
die. However, although at first glance the model looks simple and clear, each
stage is unique and has its own distinctive features. Some organizations decline
and die, while others revive after stagnation. To a large extent, this has to do
with what management decisions are made and when.

It is important for top management, business owners to understand where the
company is on the life growth curve, as only the right decisions taken at the
right time will help to keep the company alive for as long as possible. The
concept of cycles helps in setting the right priorities, solving current
problems in a timely manner. In this article, we will look at life cycle models,
as well as their practical application.

## Life cycle stages

![Life cycle stages](/samson-ZGjbiukp_-A-unsplash-1-min-1024x683.webp)

The standard model describing the journey of an organization includes 4 stages:
birth, growth, maturity, old age. The duration of these stages may vary from
organization to organization, but the maturity stage is usually the longest. Not
all organizations last for a long time. This may be due to the type of
organization, certain specifics of business, which implies a rapid rise and
decline, inability to adapt to the changing market environment.

### Birth

At the beginning of the journey, the initiator of an idea surrounds himself with
people with similar views, thus forming a team consisting of people close in
spirit. The main efforts are directed not so much at the organization itself as
at creating a product and surviving in a dynamic market. Because of this, the
size of the organization remains small and informal communication is common at
all levels of the hierarchy.

There is a significant degree of freedom and creativity in the work of the firm.
Processes are usually managed by the owner, he delves into the details of what
is going on and makes key decisions on his own. The entrepreneur is fully
responsible for the future of the organization. He is an innovator by nature,
promoting his ideas.

Gradually, a management structure is formed with intra-organizational relations,
distribution of responsibilities and formalization of authority. Eventually, a
product comes out that begins to generate income. The company grows, processes
become more complex. The first branches may appear.

### Growth

As the number of employees increases, it becomes necessary to form an
organizational culture and systematize internal processes. The product line
expands, sales grow, the firm conquers new markets. The number of employees
increases, professional managers appear.

Usually at this stage the owner of the company delegates tactical management to
the management. The main risk is that he may not be ready to delegate some of
his authority. If the owner is not ready to share responsibilities, it will slow
down the development of business processes.

At the stage of organization growth, strategic management is strengthened, the
mission and values of the company are formed. The intensity of innovation
processes increases significantly. The structure of the organization becomes
more complex, the hierarchy breaks down into several levels in accordance with
managerial powers. During this period the importance of administrative influence
and regulated management decisions grows. New instructions, procedures,
regulations on the work of departments are created. Decrees are issued, which
form the structure of the organization according to the current strategic
directions of management.

### Maturity

The main objective of this stage is to ensure sustainable growth, efficient
operation in order to maximize profits and strengthen market positions. The
development of an effective management strategy, precise adherence to internal
procedures, and careful control of costs become important. Each employee
fulfills his or her responsibilities. Performance criteria and labor evaluation
are defined, and a system of bonuses and sanctions is in place. Duties and
responsibilities are divided between divisions.

Enthusiasm is replaced by conservatism and bureaucracy. As the number of
employees grows, the number of management personnel increases, leading to
protracted decision-making procedures. This stage requires maintenance of the
achieved level rather than innovation. The main thing is to maintain a position
in the market.

### Old age

During old age, a company's business starts to decline: turnover, sales, and
profits decrease. Competitiveness weakens, and more effort is required to simply
hold on to positions. Staff turnover increases within the team, and conflicts
become more common. There may be a change in the top management of the company.

Emphasis is placed on the development of the most significant areas. Along with
the centralization of the processes of development and implementation of
management decisions, there is a high level of bureaucratization. If we go with
the flow, it is very likely that the next stage will be the complete loss of the
company's viability.

### Rebirth

A rebirth phase is not necessary. As noted above, not every company will go
through a phase of aging and death. However, organizations are not living
organisms, so they should not disappear at the end of their life cycle. But
revival awaits only those who have managed to take the necessary steps within
the allotted period of time, to direct resources for modernization in order to
restore the viability of the firm.

## Adizes Life Cycle Model

![Adizes Life Cycle](/isaac-smith-6EnTPvPPL6I-unsplash-1-min-1024x683.webp)

In 1988, the American business consultant Itzhak Adizes proposed an extended
model of the LCA. He divided the life path of a company into ten stages and
described them in his book "Life Cycles of the Corporation". According to the
author, the organization moves forward - from birth to blossom, and then to the
inevitable sunset. At the same time, death can be avoided by putting the right
manager at the helm. Adizes suggests using this principle at every stage, which
will help save the business from an early demise.

### Birth

This stage is also called the "**Passion**" stage. There is no business yet,
just a nascent idea in the mind of an entrepreneur who is enthusiastic and
determined. This is how the life journey of an organization begins.

### Infancy

The first steps will require a tremendous amount of energy and labor from the
entrepreneur. A team of like-minded people is assembled around him, ready to
keep up with the values of the business and work not so much for money as for
the idea itself. The premises are rented and the necessary documents are drawn
up.

There is a lack of a clear management structure and well-functioning business
processes, which causes crisis situations. Sales may become one of the main
problems, as optimal sales routes have not yet been found. Relationships between
colleagues are often informal. Employee replenishment occurs as needed, without
prior planning.

### Come on

This period is characterized by rapid sales growth. The organizational structure
is not yet properly built. This turns out to be an obstacle to further
development. In order to work productively, an employee needs to understand his
or her place in the company, area of responsibility and duties.

Businesses often overlook the needs of their customers. The desire to sell the
product at the maximum price is higher than the desire to improve it. Management
does not devote enough time to developing a long-term strategy and improving the
quality of service. At the same time, the cost of products sometimes does not
cover production costs, and the company operates at a disadvantage.

### Youth

If the company has learned lessons from the "Give and Take" period, then
management is changing its approach to management. It is at this stage that the
company moves to a professional management model. Adizes notes that this is the
most difficult period for an organization. The owner finds himself unable to
manage effectively and as such, he brings managers on board. The focus shifts to
profit maximization - the organization seeks to cut costs to achieve greater
financial results.

There is a redistribution of powers and a development strategy is being worked
out. Lack of mutual understanding between veterans and newcomers becomes a weak
point. Intensive growth of the enterprise requires expansion of personnel. Not
all newcomers accept the previously established corporate culture.

### Blossom

Internal processes are established and follow the described regulations. The
Corporation has reached the pinnacle of development. It actively refines its
products in accordance with customer requests. At the same time, the company
follows not only the client's wishes, but also takes into account its own
interests. Management can reject unfavorable contracts if it does not benefit
the organization.

At this stage, the company focuses simultaneously on increasing sales and
maximizing profits. To achieve great results, it is actively expanding -
launching new areas, developing products and projects. There is a clear system
of rewarding and motivating personnel.

### Stability

Stage of pleasant stability and sustainability. The organization continues to
work with customer requests, increase sales, but activity gradually decreases.
The company becomes less flexible than in previous stages. The goal of the
business at this stage is to maintain its position in the market.

Documents detailing almost every employee's every move appear. The organization
continues to develop products and launch projects, but the pace becomes more
moderate. Every innovation now requires coordination with several managers. The
first signs of decline appear - the company has passed its peak. Now it has to
move downward.

### Aristocracy

The company has become fully independent and can easily manage its current
expenses, but it stops growing because, due to formalization, the safest
possible decisions are now made. The management does not seek to master new
technologies and does not look for new markets, but focuses on creating luxury -
an office in a prestigious neighborhood, elite furniture, a strict dress code.
Employees start to be passive, avoid conflicts. Staff are required to follow
regulations exactly, even in situations where this contradicts common sense.

Demand declines, market share decreases, and products become obsolete. Profits
are declining and the company is forced to raise prices to maintain the same
level. Mergers and acquisitions with developing companies are possible at this
stage.

### Witch hunt

Sales are not growing, and the profitability of the business is falling.
Numerous conflicts break out within the team - everyone wants to find someone to
blame. The management takes decisive action: it drastically reduces prices,
closes projects, and cuts staff. The company can continue to exist through
subsidies, but if the firm is deprived of financial support, it is doomed.

### Bureaucracy

The organization is only able to exist because of external financial support.
Because of the witch hunt, control at all levels increases, which has a negative
impact on productivity. The company becomes too involved in its internal
squabbles and contradictions, interacting less and less with the external
environment. Formal communication prevails, most issues are resolved in writing,
and an unhealthy atmosphere prevails in the organization.

Relationships with customers are deteriorating. The company no longer meets
their needs or does it poorly. Nothing changes, everything is stuck on outdated
regulations and norms.

### Death

No one is interested in the company or its product anymore. Death can take
different forms and entities - termination of operations, withdrawal of assets,
sale to competitors. If a company is supported by the state or has a monopoly on
a product, its demise can be delayed. In this case, the process of
bureaucratization increases and eventually reaches its climax, leading the
organization to inevitable decline.

### Greiner's model

Greiner's model is a classical model that represents the sequence of
entrepreneurial formation in terms of temporal characteristics. Greiner's model
provides for the stabilization of successive variants, which are represented by
the four points in the example graphically. The evolution of the
entrepreneurship fission mechanism occurs through multiple variants, where each
variant represents a new characteristic.

## How to determine the stage of the life cycle

![Stage of the life cycle](/mediensturmer-aWf7mjwwJJo-unsplash-1-min-1024x681.webp)

In order to understand the specific stage of a company's life cycle, the first
step is to determine the nature of its current operations and assess its
viability. It does not matter how many years the organization has been in
business. Analyzing the organization will allow you to take process improvement
and productivity measures that are appropriate for your particular stage of
development.

Depending on the stage, potential risks and opportunities change. The decisions
taken will only really work if there are internal prerequisites for this and the
enterprise is ready to move to the next level.

A clue that it is time for a company to change is a discrepancy between internal
processes at the enterprise and the external environment. This contradiction
reduces the efficiency of the business. Such a period is difficult for any
organization, and it is impossible to avoid it. However, you can minimize the
consequences if you prepare in advance.

Given the nature of the different stages of the life cycle, it is important that
the reasons for the transition from one stage to another are consistent with the
chosen management style of the organization. If management anticipates the
transition, the timing of the transition will be key, as will the relevance of
the changes being introduced to the actual changes occurring in the company's
internal and external environment.

The main issue here is the dependence of the company's behavior on how well
management understands the needs of the business. They change depending on the
current stage of the life cycle, so the manager must always objectively assess
the measures taken for compliance. Management actions, management style should
be in line with the current stage of the cycle.

By first determining the stage of development, it will be clear what the future
holds for the organization and what measures will help to increase turnover or
improve the situation if the business is already at the aging stage. You can use
internal resources for the analysis or bring in external consultants for a more
objective assessment.

## What to do at the begin

When an organization is at the beginning of its journey, it faces two key
challenges. One is to secure the necessary financial, intellectual, labor and
material resources, and to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage.

Management should focus on the following aspects:

- Research of demand for products, services performed in the organization's
  target markets.

- Study of competitors with regard to the capabilities and resources of the
  organization, identifying the need to expand production and commercial
  potential, if there is an unmet demand, a chance to increase sales.

- Assessment of current market opportunities, adjustment of short-term and
  long-term development strategy.

- Finding opportunities to attract additional resources from outside or internal
  sources.

At the beginning of the life cycle, a company faces complex and voluminous
challenges to secure the future. Analytical work takes center stage.

## Strategy for the active growth phase

At this stage, management builds its own unique management model. It may include
both traditional methods and innovative approaches, which are used more rarely.
The main task of top management is to maintain harmony between ensuring stable
long-term development and introducing innovations. Such a balance creates
conditions for high productivity in the present and also lays the foundation for
future progress.

- The focus is on ongoing operational activities, with an emphasis on the
  development and successful implementation of innovations.

- Quality indicators are carefully monitored.

- Finding promising areas for investing profits.

- Centralization and decentralization of management processes are combined.

- Advanced developments, technological solutions are used to effectively solve
  problems.

## Maturity stage strategy

The task of management is to ensure stable development of the organization in
the long term. To avoid bureaucracy in management, it is advisable to carry out
decentralization, introduce delegation of authority and adjust employee
motivation systems. The maximum effect of managerial influence is manifested
when innovations are introduced in various spheres of organizational activity.

- It is important to carefully analyze competitors' actions in the market and
  change the company's strategy based on the current market situation.

- The technical equipment of the enterprise should be analyzed. It is important
  to modernize equipment and implement new solutions in a timely manner.

- It is necessary to constantly research customer needs, rework the development
  plan based on the findings.

- Attention should be paid to monitoring the level of team satisfaction with
  working conditions.

## Old age phase strategy

At the end of their life cycle, it becomes difficult for organizations to
achieve their goals due to decreased demand, reduced profits, increased
competition, management problems and lack of innovation.

Significant changes must be made in order to move to a new cycle of development
of the company. Only through the right management decisions can the stagnation
phase become a source of growth and rebirth, otherwise the company will leave
the market and cease operations. Management should focus on rebuilding the
business.

- Constantly monitor the market situation, control the technical condition of
  the enterprise.

- Change management style. Switch to the use of management techniques that allow
  quick response to market changes.

- Seek out new potentially lucrative avenues.

- Update the firm's equipment in a timely manner.

## Conclusion

In practice, the theory of organizational life cycles gives tangible results.
First of all, it helps to anticipate the dynamics of events and the emergence of
crises, thus providing a chance to prepare for them. It also describes in detail
the development of internal processes, which allows you to identify patterns,
natural phenomena and deviations that need to be eliminated. Based on the
theoretical model of life cycles, the manager can focus on solving real problems
and not be distracted by far-fetched difficulties that do not correspond to the
age of the company and its level of development.

The behavior of an organization at different stages of its life cycle has its
own characteristics. Regardless of the management style and goals of the
organization, management must take these characteristics into account. Conscious
analysis of the specifics and problems of each stage of the organization's life
cycle is one of the key aspects of successful management. The manager needs to
constantly analyze the current stage, assess the prospects of transition to the
next stage, and understand what factors influence it. It is also important to
identify the life cycle stage of the entire industry.
