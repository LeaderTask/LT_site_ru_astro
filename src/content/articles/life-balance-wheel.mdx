The modern world sets a high pace of life. In order not to be buried under the
weight of more and more tasks, you can use a time management technique called
"Life Balance Wheel". This technique helps you evaluate your life and isolate
the aspects that are missing to feel happy. The Wheel of Balance gives control
and allows you to make the right decisions in any area of activity. This is what
our article is about.

## History of the creation of the methodology

![History wheel of life](/history-wheel-of-life.webp)

The Life Balance Wheel scheme was invented in America in the 1970s. The author
was Paul J. Meyer. This man became one of the founders of coaching and gave the
world developments in the field of task setting, motivation, time management and
leadership. The foundation he laid became the basis for further research on
behavior patterns, which is still being conducted around the world today.

Paul J. Meyer has always gravitated toward research and development of tools in
the area of personal development. This has had an impact on the Balance Wheel.
This chart is organized around such themes as "happiness", "love",
"co-dependency", "personal and business balance".

The Wheel of Life Balance was originally divided into six sectors:

1. Family and home.

2. Finance and career.

3. Self-development and education.

4. Body and health.

5. Society and culture.

6. Spiritual development and ethics.

Modern Wheel diagrams may include other "sectors". An extended list of sectors
can be drawn, which are filled in depending on the area of use. This can be
coaching, psychology, psychotherapy, business development, and so on.

## Features of the Balance Wheel

![Features of the Balance Wheel](/balance-wheel-features.webp)

Why has the Life Balance Wheel maintained its popularity for more than half a
century? Let's take a closer look at the peculiarities of the methodology.

The wheel provides a person with an "overhead" view of their major milestones.
To analyze, one needs to look at everything that is happening from the outside.
The first step in creating the Wheel of Balance is to speak your aspirations,
goals and objectives. You can voice your hidden thoughts to another person or to
yourself. This is a good way to structure the information in your head, as well
as an exercise to make it easier to find solutions.

Every sphere of life is analyzed. Drawing a diagram of the Wheel of Balance
forces a person to evaluate all aspects. When drawing the diagram, one should
answer three questions:

- what this area of life means to me;

- what I want to accomplish in it;

- which area of my life is more important to me.

Human life is like an endless run. It is rare to find time and energy to think
about one's own life path in the midst of everyday worries. Take a test, ask
yourself such questions as: "Where am I going in life?", "Which goal in life is
closer to me?", "What is required of me in the current circumstances?", "Where
do I really want to go in life and what do I need to do to get there?".

The balance wheel allows you to analyze your state as a whole. It equalizes the
human tendency to fixate on one aspect of being: for example, to choose to think
only about failures or only about successes.

In our reality, everything is interconnected. Solving a problem often requires a
comprehensive approach, which is impossible without looking at the situation
from the outside. The Wheel of Life Balance provides such an opportunity to
assess what is happening.

The peculiarity of the method is its accessibility for independent mastering. It
does not require special education as a psychologist or economist. The desire to
change your life for the better is enough.

The balance wheel is considered a visual technique. In fact, it involves all
channels of human perception of the surrounding reality. Not only vision, but
also hearing, tactile sensations (kinesthetics), and rational thinking (digital
channel).

Aligning channels in the Balance Wheel allows you to prioritize, distribute your
efforts, and reasonably make an important decision.

## Step-by-step instructions

To create your own Life Balance Wheel, use our recommendations in a simple
step-by-step guide.

Determine what matters most to you. This can be areas such as health, family,
children, career, money, leisure, hobbies, travel, self-development, and so on.
The more areas you identify, the more detailed you will be able to examine your
life.

Draw a circle and divide it into sectors, the number of which corresponds to the
selected spheres.

Define your ideal in each area. For example, family for you means a beloved and
loving partner, three children, your own home, traveling together, and so on. Or
success in health for you means constant wellness, annual full medical
check-ups, taking spa treatments every month, and so on.

In each sector, draw a 10-point scale and mark on it the level of closeness to
the ideal. Then connect the marks with lines between them. This will create a
graph showing your current progress in each of the areas. The polygonal figure
will also clearly show in which spheres things are the best and the worst. You
can then work with the result.

What should you do if the graph turns out to be a circle? This can signal either
that you have been tricky when filling in the scales, or you are in a period of
stagnation (in other words, stagnation). Stagnation can be followed by a
decline. Therefore, the resulting circle on the chart is a signal that you need
to change and build momentum in moving forward.

Think about which sectors need to be strengthened and whether it is possible to
do so in an interesting way. Also highlight your strengths (these are the areas
where you have maximum scores). Bringing the Wheel to balance should be done on
a "Bingo" basis. That is, you need to identify a category where improvements in
that category will lead to an increase in scores in other categories. For
example, positive shifts in "Money" will lead to improvements in the sectors
"Travel", "Health", "Family", "Self-development", etc.

Remember that the sectors are interrelated. Declining health will reduce scores
in the categories of Work, Career, Travel, and Self-development. Lack of points
in "Recreation" will negatively affect "Health" and "Work" in the long run. Such
examples can be listed endlessly.

When drawing up the Balance Wheel, you need to take this into account. Find the
central elements and turn them into a fulcrum. By building off of them, you can
improve performance in "sagging" areas.

Pay attention! It is impossible to improve everything at once. You should start
with a couple of areas and gradually build up your progress.

## Time management to help you

Positive changes are impossible without clear planning. Modern time management
is a whole science that affects all spheres of human activity. Techniques and
methods of managing your own time give you the opportunity to take control of
your life.

Time management implies self-organization. It also allows you to properly
distribute the workload among your subordinates. In general, this science-based
approach to action planning helps an individual or an organization to save
resources by compressing time frames for certain amounts of work.

Improving the efficiency of actions is achieved by prioritizing goals. Urgent
and important tasks are separated from those that fall into the category of
"chronophages", i.e. "time eaters".

The principles of time management can be defined as follows:

1. **Planning**. Determine a time frame for the task, before you begin.

2. **Prioritization**. Before you begin, understand how urgent, important and
   complex the task is.

3. **Structuring**. Capture the essence of the task, track the steps of
   completion, and record the receipt of results..

There are many time management schemes that work. Among them, we will mention,
for example, the methods "Prepare from the evening", "Set deadlines",
"Autofocus", "Eating the frog" (doing the most unpleasant work first) and so on.
To combat procrastination, that is, the constant pushing aside of important
things for later, you can use the method of "A Few Minutes". According to this
method, you should force yourself to devote at least 5-10 minutes to an
important task at the first stage, after which it will be easier to get involved
in doing the whole array of work.

A good method to make yourself work is a scheme called "Small Tasks". The
beginning of the working day is devoted to preparatory work (turning on the
computer, checking corporate e-mail, and so on).

In time management, it is important to distinguish between work and employment.
Work refers to professional activities that contribute to career growth.
Employment is the endless solution of small tasks. These tasks are not
complicated, but they cause a feeling of overload, a person is spinning "like a
squirrel in a wheel".

Time management can improve the quality of work and productivity in general. In
a digitally transformed world, clear time management allows a person to stay on
track and focus on goals.
