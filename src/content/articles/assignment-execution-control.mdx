The untimely and incorrect execution of tasks by a leader is a common problem in
modern companies. The reason for this is the lack of employee motivation. When
employees understand that their work will not be evaluated or checked, they stop
taking it seriously. Employee performance decreases, the situation in the team
becomes unstable, and the company misses out on profits. To avoid problems with
task execution, regular monitoring of task completion is essential.

## How Task Execution Control Works

Practically all companies have a hierarchical structure where the leader gives
orders to subordinates, specifying deadlines for execution. To achieve results,
it's not enough to assign tasks to employees. You need to ensure that everyone
understands the essence of the task and monitor the progress of its execution.

If we are talking about a small company with just a few people, this can be done
relatively easily. In large companies with a large number of employees
performing tasks of varying complexity and volume, it is important to establish
a clear system for controlling task execution, which represents a systematic
check of the company's staff's work.

By controlling the execution of tasks assigned by the leader, it is easy to
identify deviations from the desired results, employee actions, and make
necessary corrections.

## Types of Task Control

Task control can be:

1. Preliminary: It takes place during the project preparation phase. Before
   assigning a task to an employee, the leader checks if they have the necessary
   resources and the ability to complete the task.

2. Incoming (conceptual): This is done to understand if the executor is aware of
   the tasks assigned to them. It involves assessing how the employee has
   understood the task and how they plan to solve it. This responsibility often
   falls on the leader's assistants.

3. Intermediate (ongoing): The goal is to assess the progress of the work. It
   involves checking what has been done up to a certain point, identifying any
   issues or delays in task completion, and notifying the leader of any
   deviations. If necessary, the leader makes changes to the task.

4. Final: It evaluates how well the goal has been achieved by the set deadline.
   The results obtained are compared to the planned outcomes. Based on this, the
   leader draws conclusions and makes further decisions regarding the project's
   functioning.

The task control system is built on the collaborative efforts of the leader and
their deputies. An assistant records tasks, monitors their deadlines, and
assigns responsible individuals. They periodically report on the progress to the
leader in written reports, which include information on how many tasks employees
received, who completed them, and who did not.

The task control system should be formally documented, and employees should be
informed in advance. The key provisions of the system are recorded in the
company's internal documents. Subordinates should understand how task
assignments are made and who is responsible for their control. The accompanying
documentation should outline the reporting forms for presenting intermediate and
final results.

Formal written approval of the system's provisions is of paramount importance
for the company. Holding an employee accountable for not fulfilling their duties
can only be done if these duties are documented in writing. The same applies to
rewarding employees based on their performance.

## How to Ensure Task Execution by Subordinates

To make sure that employees listen to and understand the leader, their
instructions must be adequate and well-formulated. The vaguer the task's
wording, the less likely it will be executed properly.

Here are some common mistakes that hinder the execution of management
directives:

1. Delaying the assignment of responsibility for a task, leaving little time for
   its completion.

2. Restricting the authority or time of the executor.

3. Assigning too many individuals to a single task.

4. Lack of a clear plan that allows employees to work independently without
   waiting for the leader's orders.

Employees are more likely to take their tasks seriously if the following
principles are observed:

1. Proper motivation: The executor should know how their completed tasks will
   benefit the company and contribute to their financial well-being. Employees
   should be reminded that bonuses or other rewards await them upon successful
   task completion.

2. Written documentation of agreements in specialized programs or applications:
   These records should include information about the assignment's recipient,
   deadlines for task completion. Subordinates should be aware of the tasks
   assigned to them and know that their work is being monitored by the
   department or team leader. This prevents future claims of not being informed
   about a task or forgetting it.

3. Shortening the information flow to subordinates: Various planners and
   electronic organizers can be used to keep all task-related information
   readily accessible.

4. Providing feedback to management in case unexpected problems arise during
   task execution: Leaders should listen to feedback and suggestions from their
   subordinates for possible adjustments.

5. Establishing a clear system of rewards and penalties that is understandable
   to every team member.

6. Exercising moderation in control: It's essential not to turn task and
   document execution control into constant monitoring of every action taken by
   personnel. Employees should be able to work independently without being
   distracted by minor details.

7. Mandatory tracking of each task with a thorough analysis of results.

Effective communication between performers and responsible individuals
(secretaries, assistants to leaders) is crucial for achieving positive results
in collaborative work. The SMART goal-setting system demonstrates promising
results in this regard. According to this methodology, tasks assigned by leaders
should meet the following criteria:

- Specificity: Tasks should include clear instructions on how and when to
  complete them, assign a responsible employee, and specify who will monitor the
  process.

- Measurement and evaluation of results: The outcomes should be measurable.

- Achievability: The level of task complexity should correspond to the set
  deadlines, making tasks realistically achievable.

- Relevance: Assignments should match the employee's qualifications, knowledge
  level, and abilities and have a direct relationship to the work process.

- Time-bound: Each task should have a set timeframe for completion.

Automated programs simplify task control at various levels. They facilitate
communication between leaders and employees, including remote workers.

Using task managers for organizing work with subordinates allows you to
prioritize tasks using labels and color-coding. This helps leaders stay informed
about the status of tasks and what employees are working on.

Automated personnel monitoring systems consolidate all tasks into a single
system, making them accessible for review at any convenient time. With
electronic planners, company leadership can manage tasks remotely, using tablets
or other digital devices.

## LiderTask for Task Execution Monitoring

"Convenient Software for Personnel Management: LiderTask

LiderTask is a versatile software designed for use on various electronic
devices. It allows for authorized control with the delegation of
responsibilities within a unified system. The program's features include:

1. Task creation with assignment of importance, deadlines, and statuses.

2. Assignment of responsibilities and delegates.

3. Task refinement.

4. Project and subproject creation.

5. A unified list of employees and departments.

You can view an employee's tasks by clicking on their avatar. The progress of
the assigned task is indicated by a border around the avatar. A green border
indicates that the task is assigned to that employee, while a red border
signifies that you are the assigned executor.

Within the task window, you can:

1. Communicate between the executor and the requester.

2. Set a task completion date using the calendar.

3. Attach files and reports.

Notifications about assigned tasks will be delivered to all devices available to
the executor.

The LiderTask program helps streamline document management within a company and
organize task tracking based on their completion status and quality. It is
equally suitable for entrepreneurs, leaders of large companies, and managers due
to its numerous functions, such as:

1. Individual and group access to tasks.

2. The 'task in focus' option.

3. Customizable notifications for task updates.

4. Visual cues like urgent, attention, and important.

To ensure that a task is completed on time, it is essential to assign an
executor. By assigning a task to a specific employee, you can trust that it
won't be neglected. When an employee receives a task, they mark it as 'in
progress.' Upon completion, they change the status to 'ready,' and it will
appear in the 'Ready for Submission' section. The responsible person will
receive a notification as confirmation of completion.

By using the LiderTask application, you can easily monitor the execution of
tasks and keep them within sight. The planner is user-friendly and works
efficiently on Windows, Android, MacOs, and iOS devices with synchronization
across all platforms.

The application is particularly useful for managing remote employees. Your staff
will feel the presence of leadership, understand that specific actions are
expected of them within set deadlines, and the planner will monitor the work of
remote employees, providing reports to management."

## Conclusion

Effective and systematic control over the execution of assignments ensures
comprehensive coverage of all tasks within a company for successful business
management. Secretaries and executive assistants play a crucial role in this
process.

Implementing a control system should begin with the correct task assignment.
Assignments should include the employee's name and deadline for completion. To
facilitate checking and monitoring the degree of task completion, it is more
convenient to use automated tools that simplify personnel management.

Additional means of controlling assignments are reports that provide information
on the status of task execution. Reports should be generated based on the
following criteria:

- The organizational level (reports within a department or the entire
  organization).

- Frequency (daily, monthly, quarterly).

- An approved format.

The choice of monitoring method should take into account the specific
characteristics and scale of the business.
