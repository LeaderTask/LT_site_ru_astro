Life without reference points is meaningless. Without expectations and in the
absence of the need to strive somewhere, a person becomes inert, uninitiative.
He loses faith in himself, does not realize his abilities. Does not follow his
dreams, does not do anything to improve the situation, being satisfied with the
minimum possible benefits that fate presents. Up to some time such a concept may
seem quite acceptable. But, over time, this format of life causes a sense of
hopelessness, leads to depression and chronic stress.

This statement fully applies to business. Without a clearly formulated goal and
no idea how to achieve it, the company does not develop. Employees do not stay
in the company because of low wages, lack of career development opportunities
and other shortcomings. Properly formulated goals help you become more
successful and organized. Achieve recognition in business and personal life.
SMART methodology will tell you how to compose them more effectively. Let's try
to review and characterize this tool and tell you about it in as much detail as
possible.

## Essence and description of the methodology

The author of this approach is George Doran, and the name SMART itself
translates from English as "smart". In time management this concept denotes a
system of goal setting, including specificity, measurability, achievability,
importance and their timing. According to the SMART methodology, goals should be
clear and transparent. After all, if a goal can be understood in several ways,
someone in the team is bound to misunderstand it.

- **Specific**. SMART goals should be realistic, detailed and clear in their
  wording, in clear and understandable language. Be directly relevant to the
  business. Address its requirements, capabilities and specifics. Answer the
  question: What do we want to improve? (Increase sales, develop new markets,
  etc.).The essence of the method lies in its abbreviation. It encrypts the main
  criteria that a properly formulated goal must meet. SMART is deciphered by
  letters as follows:

- **Measurable**. SMART goals should have a numerical expression. What profit
  will we get when we enter a new market? What figure will mean that the goal
  has been achieved (1 million rubles per month, 20% conversion rate, etc.).

- **Achievable**. SMART goals should be considered both ambitious and
  achievable. To achieve success, it is important not to forget about the
  resources at your disposal. They should be enough to meet your needs and
  ambitions.
   For example: *How to achieve the goal?*  *Is it too difficult for us?*  *What
  will help or hinder its realization?*  Our main competitors have 20% of the
  market share. But, our resources and capabilities are enough to capture 35%.

- **Relevant**. SMART goal does not need to contradict the company's values and
  mission. Should be in line with its core business. Become an impetus for
  further development and prosperity.
   For example: *Why do we need it?*  Engaging the contract support department
  to call customers will help increase the percentage of repeat calls by 50%.

- **Time-bound**. To have a time interval with an end date. For each smart goal
  you need to define the final and intermediate deadlines of the goal, by which
  a certain result should be achieved.
   For example: *How long will it take until the final project?*  A month, six
  months, a year, etc.

The deadline for some tasks depends on external conditions: market situation,
agreements with contractors. Therefore, it is assigned in a directive order. For
other tasks, the deadline is determined after agreement with the performers and
the manager. If necessary, it is adjusted to one side or another, for possible
revisions, survey and research work.

The less time allocated to a task, the more difficult it is to achieve. This
should be taken into account when assigning tasks to employees. Then they will
carry them out qualitatively and promptly.

## SMART formulation algorithm

### Step One: Study the company's needs and problems

SMART goal setting begins with a review and formulation of needs. It is
necessary to adequately analyze which areas need improvement and change. SWOT
analysis can be used to identify "weak" areas. It will clearly demonstrate what
factors negatively affect the efficiency of the company. What can be improved to
gain an advantage over competitors.

The SMART method is a convenient goal-setting tool used in various spheres. It
is used to formulate plans in marketing, personnel management, financial and
production environments. That is, in all areas subject to planning and
management.

When setting a goal, choose one area of the company's activity, guided by the
rule: "one SMART goal = one result". At this stage, a brief description of what
the company needs is developed. Example: a manager needs to improve customer
acquisition by increasing the number of customers. The general wording would
sound like: "Increase the number of new customers".

### Step Two: Check the relevance and importance of the goal

The result of the achievement should be an improvement in the company's
performance. That is, there should be an economic and financial benefit from its
implementation. Example: Developing new markets will increase the number of
customers. The organization will get more revenue. This will lead to profit
growth, effective development, and further modernization of the company.

The goal should be meaningful, weighty, ambitious. It should give a concrete
answer to the question: "Why?" But, at the same time, it should be relevant and
achievable. If you want to attract more customers, but your sales department is
not working effectively enough with the existing customer base, increasing the
number of requests will lead to collapse. Employees simply won't be able to
provide quality customer service. They will leave, and with them you can lose
your existing relationships. This situation is fraught with losses and financial
losses for the company, loss of customer confidence. Therefore, when planning
and formulating, it is important to correlate and evaluate the possibilities of
their realization.

### Step three: quantification

To quantify, you can use revenue, conversion, take audience reach, number of
returning customers, and other metrics. They should demonstrate the difference:
was/still. At this stage, the desired revenue, profit or other metrics are
planned. The projected figure should be achievable and real. Otherwise, the goal
will lose its meaning.

Example: you want to increase the number of customers. SMART goal at this stage:
"Increase the number of customers by 15%". For a more specific formulation, you
need to specify a deadline.Example: you want to increase the number of
customers. SMART goal at this stage: "Increase the number of customers by 15%".
For a more specific formulation, you need to specify a deadline.

### Step four: Set a deadline

There should be a deadline for implementation. A schedule of tasks with
scheduled completion dates for each stage. It will help control the workflow and
prevent important tasks from being overlooked. The deadline should be realistic.

In order to have time to perform all actions to achieve the desired result, it
should be planned with a reserve. To refine it, you can use the statistics of
previous periods. Example: 3 months are allocated for the launch of an
advertising campaign to attract clients. The wording will sound like: "Increase
in the number of new customers by 15% in 3 months".

When planning the period of achievement, it is worth limiting yourself to three
months, six months or a year. Longer timeframes will unfocus the team working on
its realization. Employees will simply forget about what needed to be done. And
the goal itself will cease to be relevant to the company under the influence of
various external factors.

Setting a deadline when formulating will help to plan tasks more effectively.
Distribute them for the selected period. If the period of its achievement is
more than three months, the goal should be broken down into several intermediate
stages. This will make it easier to monitor progress.

### Step Five: Checking whether the goal is achievable

To find out this question, we need to find out all the resource constraints.
These include:

- Timing.

- Labor, information resources.

- Cash.

- Competencies and other tools needed to successfully complete the project.

If the analysis shows that the company has sufficient resources at its disposal,
it can proceed to formulation and further implementation. If something is
missing, it is necessary to decide where to get the missing resources.

The right SMART target should be achievable. It should take into account the
value of the market and cost-effectiveness. The profit from achieving it must
outweigh the costs. Otherwise, money and time of the company's employees will be
wasted.

### Step Six: Concretize the goal

For a goal to be achievable, it must be clearly and transparently stated. It
must be understandable to all those involved in its realization. For this
purpose, action verbs should be used when setting the goal setting the goal to
make it practically applicable. This will make it practically applicable. The
indicators to be achieved in quantitative terms are specified. The deadline by
which the work should be completed is defined.

The model of goal setting according to SMART methodology is presented in the
form of a table:

| Action                           | Indicator                                                                    | Quantification                                                           | Period of performance                   | Steps to get results                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

By the end of 2022 | Win the best positions in the market. Automate production processes. Develop new business lines |

Vague, unspecific goals will not lead to the desired result. Here are some
examples of poorly drafted goals taken from the life of companies:

- Improve the quality of customer service.

- Gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

- Increase subordinates' interest in the work.

- Increase the professionalism of performers.

These formulations do not meet any of the SMART criteria. They are not specific,
not relevant. They do not have a deadline. Their implementation cannot be
monitored and quantified. Therefore, they will not lead to a concrete result.

## How SMART goals help business development

The SMART method is applicable to all types of activities. It is a good tool for
motivating employees. They clearly show what each participant in the process has
to do. What his contribution to the common cause will be and how it will affect
his financial well-being. Using the SMART technique, it is easier for the team
to focus on the fulfillment of specific tasks. And the goal itself is easier to
break down into tasks for its fulfillment.

SMART goals are easier to write step-by-step instructions describing the
elements on the way to achieving them. Due to their clarity, definiteness and
clear vision of the future result, they are easier to apply in practice. They
help to assess whether the company has enough time, money and other resources to
achieve the planned result. Provide procedures for dealing with force majeure.

Mastering the technology of setting SMART tasks facilitates the work of project
managers. This tool is suitable for business and personal settings. The
versatility, transparency, and convenience of goal-setting has made it popular
in education and the digital sphere.

## Rules for the application of the SMART methodology

The method has certain rules. These are:

- **Relevant prioritization**. The key criterion in SMART goal setting is
  "Relevant", i.e. the importance, relevance of the goal. It implies
  understanding not what needs to be done, but why.

- **Written notation**. For this purpose, you can use diaries or special
  computer programs. This is necessary for timely adjustments and revisions of
  the goal as the plan progresses.

- **Flexibility**. Goals can be affected by a variety of factors. Therefore,
  goals must necessarily be adaptive.

- **Motivation**. Setting goals for heads of divisions, departments, employees
  is accompanied by the formation of performance indicators for their
  fulfillment. It can be a bonus, bonuses to smart and productive employees,
  additional payments to the salary and other options for motivation to achieve
  the goal.
