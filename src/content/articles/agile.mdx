In 2024, project management involves the use of many tools and methods to help
improve quality, optimize the finished product. This is due to the fact that it
is difficult for large companies to deal with organizing the activities of teams
of people, since they involve a large number of participants.

To improve performance in project management, a number of distinct team
management skills need to be learned. Agile Project Management is often used for
this purpose. We will discuss what Agile is in detail in this article: we will
give an overview of the system, tell you what the term means, what the
methodology is based on and why it is so popular.

## What is Agile

Agile is a set of methods for project management in application areas, initially
used only in the IT field. Agile Project Management is used to increase the
speed of key product development, reduce development risks, and increase
communication between team members around the world. The framework makes it
possible to react quickly to the changes made and helps to quickly correct the
detected defects, errors, deviations of the customer as a whole.

Agile method is based on the classical cascade model (Waterfall), in which
processes are implemented one after another, in the order of priority, i.e. in
stages. Therefore, in case the requirements to the final goal change or a
noticeable difference from the intended plan was recorded, it is necessary to
redo the entire completed part of the work. The solution to this problem is
simple and quick due to the flexibility and adaptive properties of the
methodology.

Agile Project Management has a number of differences from other approaches that
also deal with the creation of a detailed product. The essence of Agile comes
down to the fact that there is a theoretical basis - a manifesto, which in turn
contains four core values, as well as twelve basic principles. Without these
principles it is impossible for the system to exist.

Consider what values the system manifests:

1. Communication and human connection is more important than the activities and
   mechanical tools used in the work.

2. The quality of the finished product is prioritized over detailed technical
   documentation.

3. Cooperation and mutual understanding with customers is more important than
   contractual terms.

4. Rapid response to change is more substantially committed to the original
   plan.

In addition, in Agile Project Management it is customary to distinguish twelve
work practices, which were compiled by the first followers and are the basis of
the philosophy of the agile method. They included the main points of software
development, based on the best principles and rules of testing and program
development, but now they are also useful for other areas of business. According
to these principles, the main priority in project development is to satisfy the
client's needs by delivering valuable software on a regular basis.

Also key factors of the methodology recognize the importance of changing the
product at any stage of project management (if necessary, client request,
discovered defects), frequent releases, sprints, the importance of employee
motivation, simplicity, continuous attention to design excellence.

Let us consider some fundamentally basic concepts without which this approach
cannot exist.

![What roles exist in Agile](/project-management-cover-1024x538.webp)

### What roles exist in Agile

Three roles in the agile approach are distinguished. These include the following
participants:

- product owner - a person who does not have knowledge of the technical details
  of project development, but has a general vision of the finished result; also
  realizes what audience the end result is intended for, what tasks the product
  should perform;

- action coordinator (team leader) - a master responsible for team processes and
  directing the potential of subordinates in the right direction;

- development team - the main personnel involved in creating the main product
  and realizing its technical characteristics.

At the same time, the structure in project management of a working group has a
horizontal hierarchy. In fact, the manager does not command, but sets the tone,
the general direction in which the staff further realizes tasks, comes up with
ideas, and solves issues.

An important feature of the hierarchy in Agile Project Management is that it is
not based on power, but on competence. It is competence that defines the key
parameters of interaction between subordinates and the team coordinator.

### What is throughput

Another important characteristic of the framework is throughput. This approach
implies a realized number of so-called "user stories". It includes wishes,
customer edits that form future tasks for the team. For example, installing
search filters, improving customer feedback on the site, working with tech
support. In such a short lean structure, the best iteration can be briefly
selected and implemented in a series of steps.

Throughput can also be measured. This is most often measured by the number of
user stories processed per week.

### How sequencing and prioritization are determined

The order and prioritization of iterative tasks included in the methodology
depend on the direction of the firm where Agile Project Management will be
applied. Two cycle systems are basic:

- Value Based - assessing the value, the weight of the business; here each task
  is considered in terms of its profitability, billability, reputation growth
  and aggregate level of subscriber satisfaction.

- Technology Risk Based - risk assessment from a technological point of view;
  here the priority depends on the risk of fulfillment of requirements from a
  large number of set conditions, external interaction.

### How a problem-solving schedule is drawn up

Special online services and applications with templates for project planning
allow you to make schedules, set tasks and monitor the fulfillment, noting the
degree of progress, the stage of product creation and weaknesses in the project.
Later we will tell you about one of the suitable services for such activities.

Methods within the Agile methodology are more commonly used: kanban boards and
scrum collaboration techniques. Popular tools of agile methodology are
successfully used to solve various business processes, but implementation is not
always easy and carefree, it may take more than one year. Let's consider the
best way to implement it in practice.

## How the Agile method is implemented and applied

So, what is the right way to make the transition from the conventional cascading
model used by most organizations to an Agile Project Management system with a
set of proprietary Agile methods, techniques and methods? For a painless
process, it is recommended to implement the change using several steps:

- to eliminate hierarchy, to achieve equal obligations for each participant in
  the project, so that everyone bears equal responsibility for the finished
  result;

- focus on the guaranteed benefits of each stage of development so that all
  stages and phases of the project bring something new to the table;

- explain the new principles of work to clients and senior management, and help
  them get into the process.

Implementation of Agile technology should be accompanied by the selection of the
main tool in the agile system, setting goals, deadlines, and the size of the
team. In addition, each employee must be trained in the application of these
methodologies on a mandatory basis. Management and other managers should not
hinder the process, realizing that the introduction of this system implies a new
turn in business development.

At the stage of rooting the system and transforming the work of the team, it is
necessary to additionally involve specialists with certification and experience
in Agile Project Management. They will help to form a project team, implement
the methodology, select tools, and perform the first analytics.

The procedures don't always go smoothly, but with proper attention to each stage
of implementation in project management, you will notice that processes have
become more efficient and the quality of work has greatly increased.

## Advantages and disadvantages

Continuous striving of developers and the company executing the project allows
to achieve perfect results and remain competitive for a long time. In addition,
Agile project system has other advantages over other project methodologies:

- flexible management, which allows to quickly adjust to the consumer of the
  final product, customer requirements;

- adaptive mechanisms to help you focus easily on what's important;

- transparency of the process, prompt decision-making, quick start-up, easy
  response to any changes, seamless detection, error correction;

- simplified communication, no bureaucracy, constant real-time communication
  between clients and developers;

- frequent, expected releases, shorter timeframes to deliver results;

- minimum number of defects in the final product, maximum level of development
  quality;

- increasing the functions of the finished product;

- customer focus, high level of customer satisfaction.

However, the Agile methodology also has disadvantages that cannot be overlooked.
For example, they include:

- reduction of technical documentation, which affects the process of development
  of the final product, its operational properties;

- high demand only for motivated, qualified employees;

- the inability to make long-term plans;

- lack of a direct correlation between planning acceleration and the scale of
  the product being developed, resulting in occasional architectural errors;

- constant feedback from clients, which often requires frequent revisions, leads
  to deadline postponements, and creates the threat of endlessly ongoing work;

- the need for frequent meetings with customers, distracting from the work
  process;

- the need for regular customer attendance at the production site;

- possible defects in the finished product due to the need to make quick
  decisions.

It turns out that before using the methodology in a company, it is necessary to
weigh all the pros and cons, as well as to decide whether the Agile approach in
the development of the finished product, project, product and service resonates
with a particular firm, employees, thinking of managers.

## In what cases is it used

Initially, Agile Project Management was constantly used among successful
software, game and interface developers. The most active users were considered
to be corporations: Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Adobe, WordPress, Spotify, Dell
and other families of programmers.

Today, the framework is used in almost all areas of business regardless of its
scale, cause, meaning, number of employees, projects taken. For example, it is
actively exploited by Saab, General Electric, John Deere. However, the most
effective technique is still used in the IT sphere. At the same time, Ajail is
most useful for small teams creating and improving a certain product (or
service) under conditions of uncertainty, for example, in media business.

The Agile method allows start-up companies to release the first version of a
product as quickly as possible to outpace competitors. It also works well when
developing innovative products that have no analogues, with highly unpredictable
characteristics and properties.

It turns out that the Agile methodology fits best in the life of innovative
startups, but in almost no way contributes to the performance and productivity
of large corporations with well-established processes and complex structure.
