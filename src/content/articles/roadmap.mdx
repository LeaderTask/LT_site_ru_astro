Any project starts with planning. Roadmaps are used to properly draw up plans
and track each stage of the project. They graphically display the essence of the
plan. They make all the movements within the project clear. They answer the
questions: "What?", "When?" and "Who?". A professionally compiled project
roadmap helps to rationally distribute team time, timely implement planning and
management tools, conduct various activities, and create new products. In
essence, they can be compared to ordinary road maps, which indicate routes from
one starting point to another.

## Why a project roadmap is drawn up

The roadmap is a guide to action for each project participant. It helps to
navigate the goals and direction of the company's activities. It is created for
a quarter, six months or a year. Its main purpose is to communicate the goals
and results of the tasks to the team members and stakeholders (partners,
shareholders or customers).

As a rule, a roadmap is developed for projects consisting of several working
groups. In this case, the teams can work in a separate autonomous mode. In order
not to take a wrong turn from the main path, they need to consistently fulfill
all the points of the roadmap. For example, a bank is developing and issuing a
new credit card. It involves the marketing department, design teams, programmers
and lawyers working on the bank's staff. Each department performs its own tasks,
adhering to the strategy approved in the roadmap.

Roadmap and Project Plan describe the direction in which to move in order to
realize all the goals. Both of these documents can be adjusted along the way if
various force majeure circumstances arise. For example, when shifting the
delivery dates of components. Unlike a plan that describes each task in detail,
a project roadmap provides a general overview of the project without detailing
the stages. It gives a clear and general idea of the direction in which to move
in order to complete the project on time, while the plan is a detailed
step-by-step instruction for each participant.

## Advantages of use

A roadmap helps you visually track all project milestones and make proactive
efforts where needed. Its pros:

- **Simplify goal setting**. The map is created before they are formulated.
  First, you determine where you want to go. Then you choose the path to follow.
  The map helps to see the prospects for the future existence of the project. It
  makes it easier to orientate by deadlines, manage risks and possible costs of
  the project. Example: a development team is creating a computer game. To do
  this, they first clarify what the game is for. The purpose of creating a game
  may be to realize a global idea, make a profit, or enter a new market.

- **Effective teamwork**. Using roadmap is convenient for everyone involved in
  the work process. The tool visually displays the project goals, shows its key
  points and the time it takes to reach them in order to meet the deadlines.
  Performers see their tasks and can make their own plans, focusing on the main
  goals of the project. Observe how the project is managed. Understand their
  responsibilities to other team members. The responsible manager is in charge
  of redirecting tasks to performers. Returning to the example of a computer
  game discussed in the previous paragraph, when assigning tasks, the project
  manager takes into account the need to launch a preview before the main
  product is released. The promo video will fuel the interest of users,
  attracting attention to the future game. He assigns a corresponding task to
  the designers, who provide the source material to the marketing department.
  The designers will continue to work together with the developers, developing
  the game design in accordance with the engine chosen for it.

- **Communication with stakeholders**. Third-party representatives interested in
  the early release of the product can clearly see the work on the project on
  the roadmap. They can track all changes, make any adjustments. Since all
  important information is displayed in general terms, there are no
  misunderstandings between executors and customers about the methods or tools
  chosen for the work. For example: an investor wants to get information about
  the state of the product at a given stage. The roadmap will make it easier for
  the team to demonstrate the progress of work to the customer, explain the
  reasons for the increase in budgeted costs, and show what result the next
  investment in the project will produce.

- **Proper prioritization**. Already at the map creation stage it becomes clear
  how the project tasks will be executed. They are prioritized by priority and
  execution time. The map indicates who needs more time to complete the task.
  The team members who can cope with the tasks within a limited time frame with
  possible further revision are identified. Time is allocated so that all team
  members can complete the tasks in a timely manner and achieve the goals
  together. For example, when creating a game, more time should be allocated for
  the development of its characters. This means that the designers' tasks will
  be prioritized in terms of complexity and time.

A product roadmap incorporates relevant changes in the course of the project
work proposed by management, customers, product creators, and other stakeholders
in a timely manner. They can be used to identify failures that occurred on the
way to the goal.

## Areas of application, methodology

![Areas of application roadmap](/dorozhnaya-karta-1024x372.webp)

As mentioned earlier, we created a project roadmap to visualize the project,
showing milestones, goals and workload of each participant. But, it is not an
action plan or project tracker. The map contains a description of goals without
methods to achieve them.

The roadmap should specify the following factors:

- Business outlook revealing the fate of the project in the near future.

- A strategy. Or an action plan that tells you how you can achieve your
  envisioned prospects.

- Objectives. Limited periods of time at the end of which the actions performed
  can be evaluated.

- Approximate time required to achieve the goals.

- Functionality. The main characteristic of the future product.

- Task statuses for easy tracking of task work.

- Metrics to clarify goal attainment.

Roadmaps are used:

- When creating new products. They spell out the goals of their creation,
  specify the participants who will work with it, specify the deadlines for the
  tasks and the strategy for bringing it to market.

- When launching projects. The maps indicate all their stages, from the idea to
  the management of each stage. Their start and completion dates are displayed.

- In the process of implementing new programs and ideas. In this case, they
  describe what actions and in what sequence should be performed to achieve the
  final result. For example, to modernize the software in the company without
  losing stored data. The map indicates the goal, its step-by-step realization,
  possible risks, deadlines and checkpoints. With its help, it is easier to
  control the process and correct errors that occur.

- When developing a strategy for the development of an industry or large
  industry segments. The procedure is aimed at supporting and developing
  individual market segments.

- For staff development and training. In this case, a roadmap is developed
  within a specific company or enterprise. To improve the qualifications of the
  medical staff of a private clinic, its head physician develops a roadmap with
  a schedule of step-by-step training for each department. It also contains
  information on training goals, timelines and plans.

- For company development. Creating roadmaps within companies is aimed at
  achieving their long-term goals and scaling the business. They are a kind of
  motivators for employees who, looking at them, realize what result they are
  working for.

## Types of road project maps

Roadmaps can be cascading or agile by the nature of the stages. Cascading
roadmaps (Waterfall) imply a sequential transition from stage to stage: from
idea to design, development, testing and launch. Flexible roadmap (Agile)
involves breaking down the process of working on a project into separate parts,
sprints.

The advantages of cascade maps include their clear structure. They are
convenient to use for project reporting. However, due to their lack of
flexibility, they are difficult to adjust to force majeure.

When using flexible project maps, constant interaction between executors,
management and customers is ensured. This allows any corrections to tasks to be
made quickly if necessary. But, they are intended for workers with a high level
of skill and experience, who are able to note the need for adjustments in a
timely manner.

By nature of application, project roadmaps are:

- **Product**. They contain a strategy for improving or developing a product
  (service). Documents of this type are oriented to performers.

- **Technological**. Reflects the strategy of development of the company's
  material and technical base.

- **Marketing**. They contain the team's plans to promote the developed product.

- **Personnel**. Demonstrate to management the need to hire additional
  specialists to accomplish project tasks.

- **Customer**. Provide customers with information about available products or
  services, demonstrate the benefits of potential cooperation and prospects for
  its further development.

- **Aimed at increasing sales**. They are created for sales managers. Their
  purpose is to familiarize performers with the expected results of their work
  and deadlines for task completion.

- **Corporate**. These are schemes with tasks set for each department of the
  company.

The project roadmap may vary depending on its objectives and the specifics of
the company's business.

## How to make a project roadmap

To begin with, the following questions need to be clarified:

1. What is the purpose of creating a roadmap? What is it needed for? For
   example, to launch a new product or develop a new line of business for a
   company.

2. How will it be presented? In the form of a line with marks indicating time
   segments, a table with columns or a kanban board.

3. Which tasks will be prioritized? To do this, allocate important tasks,
   identify checkpoints to be passed on the way to their fulfillment.

4. Who will be responsible for the end result? As a rule, this function is
   assigned to department heads or employees with relevant qualifications and
   experience.

## Conclusion

A roadmap is an effective project management tool that allows you to clearly see
each stage of a project. But even a well-designed roadmap does not guarantee
success when launching a project or a new product. When drawing it up, avoid
unnecessary water and excessive detailing. The roadmap should be clear and
concise. Don't forget to review it regularly and adjust it. This will help you
stay on track and ensure successful movement in the right direction.
