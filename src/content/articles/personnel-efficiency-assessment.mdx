The success and stability of any company is influenced by the efficiency of its
employees. Some of them actually work out their salaries, while others only give
the appearance of active work, being engaged in personal affairs. To determine
how the actions of each employee affect the productivity of the company, the
assessment of personnel efficiency helps. It shows to what extent an employee
corresponds to the position he holds, and to what extent his salary level
corresponds to his contribution to the company's development.

## Why evaluate staff performance

According to statistics, 70% of company employees are constantly distracted from
the work process. Using messengers, social networks, calling home during working
hours - all this prevents them from concentrating on their main duties. And only
40% of employees understand the essence of the tasks assigned to them by their
managers. Because of this, companies lose 20 to 30% of their revenue every year.

To avoid losses due to irrational use of labor resources, personnel performance
evaluation is applied. This is a system of criteria determining how well a
person corresponds to the position he holds and how he copes with the assigned
work. Studying the productivity of employees is useful not only for managers,
but also for the performers themselves.

**The study takes into account:**

- the amount of work performed by the employee;

- complexity;

- compliance of the performed tasks with the job responsibilities;

- the results of the work and the time spent on it.

- resources expended.

Employee evaluations accomplish the following objectives:

- Determine the skills, abilities, and professional level of performers.

- Make the right personnel changes.

- Improve the KPI and motivation system in place in the company.

- Eliminate chaos and clutter in the workforce.

**Based on the results of the assessment, many strategic decisions can be made
that have potential benefits for the company. For example:**

- Build an employee promotion matrix.

- Develop a checklist system based on the real level of staff knowledge.

- Draw up a plan for training and professional development of employees.
  Conclude agreements with training organizations.

- Identify leadership candidates who can develop from line workers into
  competent managers.

- Analyze work processes, identify weaknesses in the company's business
  strategy.

It is necessary to conduct a preliminary personnel assessment at the hiring
stage. This will help to determine the future composition of the work team by
establishing a minimum list of requirements for applicants. Once an employee has
been hired by the company, he is regularly checked for compliance with the
position held.

Personnel performance evaluation is necessary if the company is experiencing a
constant outflow of personnel, decreasing labor productivity. Or when employees
complain about poor working conditions, disrespectful attitude, low wages.

**Staff appraisals are performed in the following cases:**

- In workforce planning.

- When recruiting company personnel.

- When organizing trainings, training for managers.

- To build a talent pool.

The analysis of indicators characterizing the efficiency of personnel
utilization allows the company to hire people with the right qualification
level, knowledge and abilities. This allows the company to significantly reduce
the cost of services of intermediaries engaged in personnel recruitment, reduce
the number of interviews in the company.

**Increase the efficiency of each employee can be improved at:**

- A mutual willingness to work. In order for each team member to work with full
  dedication, the manager should outline the prospect of possible growth and
  rewards in the form of bonuses or bonuses. This will have a positive effect on
  both sides. The employee will improve his well-being and the organization will
  gain additional profits due to rational use of labor resources.

- Turning a subordinate's personal self-interest into a tool for increasing his
  effectiveness. Recognizing a particular person's interest can be used as
  motivation.

- The manager's interest in the success of the staff. If team members feel
  "important" and useful to the company, they will do their best to justify the
  trust placed in them.

- Creating a comfortable workplace environment.

It is necessary to assess the competence and quality of personnel work on a
regular basis. Every business representative realizes this. But how can this be
done correctly? After all, a person can quite cope with his duties, but at the
same time constantly distract his colleagues, asking for their help. Or not meet
the deadlines. For this reason, the efficiency of each employee is determined on
the basis of many indicators, including labor costs and time spent on work. In
Japan, for example, this indicator is determined on the basis of each employee's
abilities.

Based on the assessment of personnel performance, they develop a system of
bonuses and rewards. They make decisions on their transfer to new positions or
dismissal.

## Personnel performance evaluation criteria

In order to properly evaluate the efficiency of an employee, it is necessary to
consider his working, personal, and behavioral characteristics. For this
purpose, performance evaluation criteria are used to determine how each function
should be performed. The criteria are developed by company managers together
with representatives of the HR management service or together with subordinates.

The joint development of evaluation criteria has a lot of positive aspects for
the company. They will be understood by the management staff and performers.
They will not cause rejection among the performers. They will be based on the
peculiarities of each specific work process.

**In terms of coverage, the way of evaluation, the criteria are divided into:**

- Organization-wide and specialized.

- Quantitative (results achieved are evaluated) or qualitative (individual
  qualities of an employee and the quality of work performed by him are taken
  into account).

- Objective (standards approved for each work process) or subjective (formed on
  the basis of expert opinions).

- Integral or simple.

The development of evaluation criteria begins with the identification of a list
of positions. The functional responsibilities of the selected groups are then
defined. The possibility of applying the criteria for each specific case is
analyzed. The amount of information about the object of research is taken into
account, the importance of each criterion applied in personnel assessment is
specified.

### Competency assessment

Examines the professional, personal qualities and knowledge of employees. This
category includes:

- Professional skills. Evaluated on the basis of tests, examinations, compliance
  with industry-approved standards.

- Communication skills. Help determine an employee's place in the team. Leader
  or outsider? Conflicted or loyal to colleagues? You can get this and other
  information about an employee from psychological tests and interviews
  conducted by the HR department.

Competency assessment also includes job performance, attitude, work ethic and
company loyalty.

### Staff performance

The performance of each employee is compared with the indicators planned for his
position. Before an employee's performance is evaluated, he is assigned specific
tasks. Performance is measured in the volume of sales per month. It can also be
displayed in the number of realized projects or concluded deals for the
reporting period.

**KPI or Key Performance Indicators are expressed as a percentage**:

- of sales to the number of calls handled;

- the number of repeated requests of clients to the total number of clients in
  the database;

- results to resources expended.

To assess performance using the KPI method, a table divided into two columns is
used. In one of them write down the evaluation criteria (quantitative or
qualitative, individual or team). The second column contains the competencies
approved for the position. The head of the unit assigns numerical values of 0 or
1 to the selected indicators, based on his own observations. The numerical
values in each row of the table must be equal to one.

**The effectiveness of KPI indicators has three levels:**

- Baseline (the starting point from which the result is counted).

- Normal (binding under all conditions).

- Target or ideal (to which all employees should strive).

KPI indicators are assessed at the end of the reporting period. Qualitative
values are assessed on a 100-point scale. Quantitative values are measured using
the metric system. To determine the private result of an employee, the formula
is applied:

**(Actual data minus base KPI ÷ Norm minus base) × 100% = percent result.**

The data obtained shows the extent to which the employee has met or exceeded his
target. If the KPI is above 100%, the employee's performance is high. If this
parameter is below 100%, it indicates that the staff is working inefficiently.

Each organization develops its own evaluation criteria, taking into account its
specifics.

## Methods of personnel performance evaluation

Various methods are used to determine the performance of a company's employees.
According to the direction, method of evaluation they are:

**Qualitative**. Otherwise known as descriptive. This includes:

- Matrix method. The characteristics of the performer are compared with the
  reference model corresponding to his position.

- Assessment of task performance. It implies answering the question, how is the
  employee doing his job?

- The method of system of arbitrary characteristics. Otherwise it is called the
  method of extremes. A manager or a representative of the personnel service
  makes a list of achievements and failures of an employee, and draws
  conclusions about his professional suitability.

- "360 degrees". The employee's performance is assessed by his colleagues,
  immediate supervisor and the subordinate himself. Information about the
  subordinate is collected by means of a questionnaire consisting of questions
  divided into separate blocks related to the employee's activities.

- Group discussion. It is conducted in the form of direct discussion of the
  employee's labor results with the management and invited experts. Using this
  method, it is possible to visually assess the employee's stress resistance,
  communication skills with staff and management. Both parties can ask questions
  during the discussion.

**Quantitative**. Expressed in numbers. They give a more objective idea of the
usefulness of each member of the work team. They include:

- Scoring method. An employee receives points for work performed on a 10- or
  5-point scale. At the end of the reporting period (month, quarter or year)
  they are added together and analyzed.

- Free point evaluation method. Qualifications, skills and characteristics of an
  employee are evaluated by an expert committee. Based on their sum, a final
  rating is compiled.

- Ranking method. A committee of department heads is created to make a kind of
  ranking of employees based on their performance and usefulness. After
  comparing data from different sources, employees at the bottom of the list are
  dismissed or transferred to lower-paid positions.

**Combined**. Combine quantitative and qualitative methods. They give the most
complete and objective assessment of employee performance. These are:

- Sum-of-evaluations method. All characteristics of an employee are evaluated on
  a set scale. On the basis of the data obtained, an average indicator is
  derived and compared with the benchmark accepted for this position.

- Grouping system. Depending on performance, employees are grouped into common
  groups consisting of leaders, "middlers" and outsiders. Then decisions are
  made as to who should be dismissed or moved to the top group.

The listed technologies provide an incomplete assessment of personnel
performance or their socio-psychological qualities. Therefore, comprehensive
methods based on a combination of all assessment approaches have recently gained
popularity.

### Methods of competence assessment

These methods of analysis are used for in-depth study of professional qualities
of employees in order to effectively utilize the company's human resources
potential. On their basis they calculate ways to increase labor productivity at
the enterprise, develop measures to reduce expenditures on wages of incompetent
employees. These methods include:

- Attestation. Includes assessment of qualification, practical and theoretical
  skills of the employee. Analysis of his labor results, personal and
  professional characteristics. Conducted on the basis of standards approved for
  each position and specialty, according to a pre-approved plan with a frequency
  of three, two or once a year. The head of the company has the right to certify
  all employees, except for top managers, employees with less than one year of
  service or pregnant employees.

- Assessment center or assessment center. It consists of three stages:
  preparation, scenario development and the assessment procedure itself,
  consisting of business games, group discussions, interviews and tests.
  Application of this method gives an objective picture of the compliance of the
  staff with the goals, structure and policy of the company. Due to the
  complexity of implementation, this methodology is used mainly in large
  companies.

- Testing. It is based on professional and psychological tests. It helps to
  identify the employee's level of knowledge, their suitability for the position
  held, as well as their personal characteristics.

- Interview. A series of questions to be answered by the employee. It can be
  conducted in a free or structured form. The maximum effect is given by the
  structural-behavioral interview, which invites the candidate to simulate a
  certain situation that arose in his professional activity, find a way out of
  it and evaluate his role.

- Expert assessment. Professional and personal qualities of employees are
  assessed by the company's own or hired specialists.

- Business games. A model of a real business situation is created. In the course
  of the game the employee shows his professional and personal qualities,
  demonstrates his ability to work in a team. Demonstrates stress resistance,
  ability to react quickly to changes in the working situation.

When applying these methods to evaluate staff performance, it is important that
they are objective and easy to understand.

## Conclusion

The function of the HR department and company management is not limited to
assessing the performance of employees, identifying "problem areas" and
dismissing incompetent specialists. It is possible to get a positive result from
the work of subordinates by offering them transparent and mutually beneficial
cooperation in return. Personnel performance evaluation should be a constructive
dialog that benefits both parties.

The results of the study are formalized in the form of reports or tables that
contain detailed information about the employee. Based on them, the management
makes a decision on his further employment with the company.

There are many techniques for studying performance. They have both positive
sides and disadvantages. Therefore, when choosing a research method, it is
important to take into account such factors as the structure of the company's
personnel, the specifics of its activities, and relations between employees.
