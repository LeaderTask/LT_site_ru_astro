Any freelancer or project manager is familiar with the expression deadline,
which means a deadline by which a task must be completed. Literally translated
from English, "deadline" sounds like "death line". Fortunately, in modern
terminology, it does not mean that you are expected to be immediately physically
destroyed for failure to meet the deadline of a project or order. But, once upon
a time, a violated deadline was indeed dealt with in the harshest way possible.
Let's try to understand what this expression means and how deadlines are applied
in various spheres of life and business.

## History of the origin of the term

The term "deadline" was coined in 1860 in the United States, during the Civil
War. It referred to a kind of security fence that bounded the area around a
prison. "The Death Line was set about six meters from the fence. Any approach of
a prisoner to the line, up to and including touching it with a fingertip or
foot, risked instant execution.

In the 20th century, the concept of "deadline" moved from the prison lexicon to
the printing industry. This term was used by newspapermen to denote the deadline
for submitting a prepared publication to the press. Today this word is used in
professional ethics and ordinary life much more often, it can be heard in the
vocabulary of specialists in various fields: programmers, freelancers,
designers, managers, students, copywriters, marketers, athletes.

The expression deadline refers to the key concepts of planning and time
management. Helps to make any abstract plans concrete and measurable. Teaches
how to manage your time correctly and rationally to achieve better results.

## Why a deadline is necessary

In simple terms, a deadline is a "deadline" or a limit point in time by which a
task must be fully completed. The deadline can be as precise as possible, down
to specifying hours and minutes. For example, copywriters working on the
exchange, give orders to a clearly defined deadline. Failure to comply with
deadlines leads to unpleasant consequences. An untimely order is detrimental to
sales and threatens to diminish your reputation in the market. Delay in filing
tax returns is fraught with penalties. In other words, the consequences of not
meeting deadlines can be purely reputational, or quite serious.

For some people, the word deadline evokes negative emotions because of obsessive
thoughts about possible problems that will inevitably arise when deadlines are
missed. This leads to stress, emotional tension. So why complicate your life
voluntarily and wear yourself out with artificially imposed restrictions?

In fact, there are quite a few useful benefits to be gained by using deadlines.
Thanks to this planning tool, you will be able to:

- Achieve your goals in a timely manner. Once you have determined how much time
  you have, you will have no desire to put off key tasks "for later". As you
  move from stage to stage in small steps, you will notice how much closer you
  are to your main goal.

- Improve personal and team performance, focus on what's important. Companies
  that set specific deadlines for employees improve productivity. Having a
  deadline prevents the performer from getting bogged down in procrastination
  and is a great incentive to work actively during the day.

- Establish effective communication within the team. Specific deadlines make it
  easier to coordinate sequential and parallel stages of work within the overall
  project. An example is the creation of an advertising page for the launch of a
  new product. It is necessary to involve a team of several specialists:
  designer, editor, copywriter, marketer. By properly setting deadlines for each
  performer, you can avoid time wastage, allowing you to finish the project
  quickly. Each team member will know that they need to complete their task by a
  certain deadline.

- Allocate effort rationally. Knowing how much time you have available for a
  particular task can help you break it down into even segments. You will be
  less overloaded and clearly understand the amount of work that needs to be
  done during the day.

- Find the necessary resources to complete the task on time. In order not to
  "fail" the overall project, some of its tasks can be assigned to other
  specialists. If you do not have a person in your team with sufficient
  experience or knowledge to develop the design of the site, this task is better
  to assign a freelancer, setting him the appropriate time. And, you will take
  care of other current tasks.

Artificially limiting the deadline for a project allows a new manager to test
his or her work team. This is the best way to figure out who can do the work in
the team, who is a leader or, on the contrary, an outsider. Who knows how to act
in stressful situations, and who gets stumped or hysterical when deviating from
the chosen course.

## Minuses of time limits

Hard deadlines are an effective time management method that allows you to
achieve better results in less time. But, it also has its certain disadvantages:

- The realization that a task must be completed by a strictly defined time is
  inevitably accompanied by stress in the performer. In small doses, the feeling
  encourages to perform active actions, but over time it can turn into a
  compulsive fear of failure. If the violation of deadlines is followed by
  material penalties or reprimands, stress can grow into a prolonged depression.
  And then even the usual business, which was excellent before, the employee
  will not be able to do properly.

- If deadline is set illiterately, without taking into account the complexity
  and specificity of the assigned tasks, it can lead to financial losses for the
  company. When promising a customer to deliver a finished product by a certain
  time, the manager must be absolutely sure that all work within the project
  will be completed by that date. When planning, it is always necessary to allow
  time for possible revisions or adjustments.

Violation of deadlines can be due to personal reasons, such as illness or
unforeseen circumstances in which a person found himself and did not complete
the work. But, most often it happens because of laziness, disorganization and
the habit of putting everything off "for later". Performers who do not meet
deadlines that are related to work, in normal life behave accordingly:

- go shopping for Christmas gifts at the store on December 31;

- pay invoices and submit reports by the last day of the deadline indicated on
  them;

- are always late because they get dressed in a hurry just before they leave
  because of the late rise.

In the course of work, such employees are always looking at their watches. Since
they have to act extremely quickly to get everything done, they have no time to
check the completed task or identify mistakes. Of course, the quality of work in
this mode is out of the question.

You can get rid of the bad habit of putting off work "for tomorrow" with the
help of a daily planner. If you schedule your time by hours and minutes and
follow the plan, you won't have to grab a thousand things to do at the end of
the working day.

## How to learn self-organization

![How to learn self-organization](/samoorganizatsiya-1024x372.webp)

Learning to complete tasks on time is difficult but possible. You need to follow
three simple principles:

1. Taking responsibility. In a common project, each employee is busy with his or
   her own task that affects the final result. If he or she fails to complete
   the task by the deadline, it can lead to a failure in the work of the whole
   team. A great incentive to "speed up" performers is to set intermediate
   deadlines in the task.

2. Sober assessment of opportunities and resources. When we set ourselves a
   certain task, we often overestimate ourselves. When planning, you should take
   into account your speed of work and the complexity of the task. Work through
   this information in your mind. And only after working through this
   information should you set specific deadlines for yourself or your executors.
   When communicating with the management or the customer, it is better to
   stipulate in advance the possibility of a slight deviation from the set time
   (by a day or two, a few hours), in order to verify the result obtained.

3. Use of a redline or "red line". This term is used by businessmen to refer to
   a tentative delivery date to control the degree of readiness of a project. If
   there are any comments, it is sent for revision.

## Types of deadlines

This tool is applicable to any sphere of life. In legislation, it is the
deadline for submitting reports. In journalism, this term refers to the time
when a publication goes to press. For programmers, copywriters, freelancers, it
is the time when it is necessary to fully complete work on an order or project.
Deadlines are an effective tool of marketers. They are included to stimulate
consumer interest and increase buyer activity. It's hard to refrain from buying
if you receive a text message informing you that the products of your favorite
brand are 50% off today. And it is valid only until the end of the day. Having
received such a message, many people immediately go to the store, even though no
purchases were planned for the current day.

## Rules for meeting deadlines

No matter how valid the reasons for the failure of projects, their systematic
violation leads to loss of reputation and financial losses for the contractor
and the company. To avoid letting yourself, your colleagues and your company
down, you need to follow a few simple rules:

- Calculate in advance how much time you need to complete the task. Think back
  to the time period you took to complete a similar project. Always plan a
  deadline with enough time to spare.

- Conduct an honest analysis of why you violated the deadline of previous tasks.
  Maybe you are constantly distracted by extraneous matters? Or you don't have
  enough knowledge, experience, capabilities to cope with the task?

- Get started right from the start of the project. Prepare the necessary
  information and structure future processes. Do small tasks immediately and
  deliver them before the deadline.

By following these simple steps, you will get rid of fear and insecurity. You
will realize that adherence to strict time limits is not a punishment, but a
great incentive to work harder and more efficiently to get better results.
