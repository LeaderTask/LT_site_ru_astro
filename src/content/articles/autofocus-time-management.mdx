## Caesar\`s method doesn’t work

People know Caesar who could switch from one task to another easy and quick. But
in real life we always have to get distracted to check the Inbox, make several
calls and talk to teammates. Meanwhile your work is added with new tasks,
questions and decisions.

In this case you are working in a multitasking mode and as a result you can
waste up to 40% of your time. Your brain just can't talk out of both sides of
mouth and also it needs some time to concentrate on tasks again. How to master
performing tasks without wasting time?

## Secret of your efficiency

- **Planning focus**

A well known Pareto principle says 20% of your efforts give you 80% of your
results. You have a lot of good ideas but how not to get lost in them?
LeaderTask developed a special feature — autofocus time management.

- **Achieving goals**

Concentrate your attention on the most important goals. They are situated on the
main screen. This avoids you from getting distracted by minor tasks and controls
your time more effectively.

How does it work?

It is very easy to use it — just select the red flag with the inscription
“Focus” in a task you want to highlight. The whole section was made for the most
important. When you are in the section “Focus” you can work with tasks. All you
need is at your sight.

team and yourself and set time for concentrated work. This tool allows you to
add the most important and current tasks to your to-do lists and the instinctive
navigation helps you to conquer peaks without wasting time!
