Personnel control at enterprises takes place in different ways. Some managers
limit themselves to reports and the results of work done, others invest in
security services and video surveillance. Still others develop automation,
preferring GPS trackers and remote CRM systems.

What is the purpose of such monitoring? Does it benefit the company or limit
actions? What happens if employees are not monitored? And how best to automate
the process of monitoring the work of employees? All the questions will be
answered in today's article.

## Why control is needed

Monitoring staff performance is not only necessary for the manager or officer in
charge of the project. But also the employees of the organization. In this case,
the boss knows that he will definitely get results, loyalty and a reliable team.
And the staff develops professionally, grows, can claim a higher and more stable
salary. In addition, control makes the requirements and rules clear.

Proper organization of personnel activity control improves the following points:

- makes KPIs, responsibilities, and sanctions clear for employees, so that they
  produce predictable results and fail fewer tasks and projects;

- increases trust and confidence between business partners, counterparties, due
  to which the company does not disrupt deadlines;

- forms a stable quality of work, allowing the business to become competitive,
  to be highly valued in the market;

- improves the quality of crisis management, as the team is characterized by
  well-oiled management, reliability;

- identifies problems and errors at the first stages of project implementation,
  which makes it cheaper to correct deficiencies;

- increases employee loyalty as management is able to award bonuses in a fair
  manner;

- captures successes rather than failures, which helps to motivate the team and
  develop them professionally and personally.

Employee monitoring is a mutually beneficial cooperation between two parties,
which is implemented for the common good of the team. Monitoring also helps to
identify unscrupulous, dishonest, lazy and unmotivated employees who are not
interested in their work and career. Timely detection of such persons allows to
reduce the level of theft at the enterprise, notice untimely arrival and
departure, prevent internal espionage, identify fraudsters, find the "weak link"
among employees.

## What happens if you don't supervise your staff

Any job, even an interesting and highly paid one, continues to be an employee's
responsibility and implies serious efforts. Lack of control greatly relaxes the
team and leads to poor results. Let's analyze in more detail the main problems
that will arise in the absence of discipline and low level of control in the
company.

### Employees stop working

Every living creature strives to save energy, it is a basic law of nature.
Therefore, in the absence of real control, most employees gradually begin to
follow the path of least resistance: they do tasks quickly and poorly, expending
minimum effort, procrastinate, drink tea, and spend time in idle conversations.

### Employees who are not coping are not visible

Some teammates do quite a lot but pay lip service. However, their abilities and
capabilities may be severely limited. Without regular monitoring, it is
impossible to keep track of which employees are missing deadlines due to lack of
qualifications, skills, and motivation. Especially among outsourced team
members.

### Failing executives also get lost from view

Some supervisors have a fairly high level of knowledge, but may perform poorly
due to employee bias, belittling, firing valuable employees. Some may withhold
information valuable to the team and the company in order to receive high
bonuses and look good in the eyes of top management.

Thus, properly organized monitoring of employees' work is not a whim of
employers, but a necessity, with the help of which team members work
productively. With monitoring, employees have the opportunity to be objectively
evaluated, as well as to independently analyze their personal contribution to
the firm's activities. This increases staff motivation and business
productivity.

## Types of personnel control

There are several types of employee activity control. Among them there are
preliminary, final, stage-by-stage.

### Preliminary

This monitoring should not be used too often, as constant monitoring puts
pressure on the staff. But it can be useful in a number of cases. For example,
when a new employee is being trained in the company. The manager just needs to
make sure that the project is moving in the right direction.

### Final

It is used in work to check the final results of labor activity, when an
employee has already achieved a certain goal, solved a task. Such monitoring is
carried out on the basis of a work report, project completion, won dispute in
court, launched software.

The advantage of this type of control is that it gives the employee a certain
degree of autonomy. It allows him to feel trust, thanks to which the employee
tries to take responsibility for the fulfillment of the task, develops
professionally. At the same time, the manager will be able to save resources,
time, energy and will not be distracted from the implementation of direct
affairs.

Among the disadvantages of this type of control is the significant risk of
violating the deadlines of the assignment or the performance of low-quality work
by the staff. Especially when it comes to tasks performed by a new or
inexperienced employee. Therefore, this type of control is only suitable for
proven, qualified employees.

### Step-by-step

It is used when it is necessary to break down a task into specific stages. This
type of control focuses the personnel on the result rather than on the processes
of labor performance. This helps minimize the risk of failure to achieve the
final goal.

How is phased personnel control applied to work activities? The administration
or manager divides the task into several logical subtasks. For example, to
collect data, analyze the problem, search for solutions, choose one of them, and
then prepare documentation, submit documents to state authorities for
registration. After completing the sub-stage, as well as the last stage, the
supervisor conducts an inspection.

Step-by-step employee supervision is best suited for large tasks with long lead
times. It is also useful when dealing with inattentive, process-oriented
employees who require frequent supervisor support.

## Methods of personnel control

Of course, in no case should you stand behind your own colleagues' backs and
rigidly control their every move. This will lead to tension in the team, stress
and will even worsen the performance of the department and work to a
disadvantage. The most effective methods of control include:

1. Creating an environment where team members watch out for each other.

2. Unobtrusive monitoring performed without the direct presence of management.

The most productive way is to combine both methods and apply them equally in the
work of any department of the company. In this case, the result will not be long
in coming.

## How to organize control over employees' work

Competent personnel monitoring is organized in accordance with the basic
principles of effective monitoring. We have identified seven such rules.

### Transparency

Every employee in an enterprise should be aware that his or her performance is
monitored. He should also know what tools are used for this purpose, what key
performance indicators are evaluated and what consequences await him as a result
of effective or poor performance.

The most convenient way to do this is to use a clear regulation, i.e. a written
manual or regulation for monitoring staff performance. All the key points of
control are prescribed in it. Each employee should know its content and
understand the working conditions.

### Predictability

A sense of stability and security is the key to productive activity. The control
system must be clear and not change too often. Whereas self-sabotaging
supervisors only undermine their authority and reduce productivity.

### Objectivity

The rules for monitoring employees should be the same for the whole team.
Impartiality is the best assistant in monitoring. Whereas subjectivism and
favorites have no place in business.

### Imperceptibility

Keeping abreast of everything and getting involved in every project are two
completely different, incompatible processes. A manager should only act
according to a pre-approved plan, unless it is an emergency situation.

### Permanence

A well-oiled system is a regular system. If the management starts supervising
the activities of subordinates, it should do it on a regular basis, not abandon
or weaken the supervision, bring it to a point.

### Efficiency

Administrative staff, supervisors, managers and other top managers who supervise
staff should not devote all their time to monitoring other staff. Otherwise,
they will simply not have time to conduct their activities, which will affect
the performance of the whole business.

### Effectiveness

Monitoring just for the sake of monitoring does nothing. It is necessary to
understand what to do with the results of monitoring: to identify effective
employees or problem areas, to think about further actions, to unlock potential
or to eliminate shortcomings.

## Mistakes

No matter how much a manager strives to increase productivity and improve
employee performance, he or she can always face the opposite effect. This is
most often caused by common administrative shortcomings. There are only three of
them:

- haphazard monitoring, which is concerned with identifying performance
  shortcomings, complete disregard for the team's achievements and successes;

- controlling the activities of employees in which the supervisor does not
  understand or understand anything;

- formal monitoring leading to the same formal actions of employees.

In addition, unethical methods of monitoring the team are never allowed. These
include listening to telephone conversations, reading messages, surveillance by
mounting video cameras, monitoring employees through a webcam on a PC or its
computer screen.

Tracking the work of the team should be done legally, correctly and
systematically, without backlash and negative impact. In this case, employees
will not be afraid of punishments, dismissals, but will begin to strive for high
performance and fruitful activity. And personnel control in the company will
turn into an obvious plus.
