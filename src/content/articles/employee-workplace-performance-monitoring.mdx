Employee monitoring practices vary across enterprises. Some managers rely on
reports and work results, while others invest in security services and video
surveillance. Some opt for automation, preferring GPS trackers and remote CRM
systems.

What is the purpose of such monitoring? Does it benefit the company or restrict
actions? What happens if employees are not controlled? And how best to automate
the process of employee work monitoring? We will answer all these questions in
today's article.

## **Why control is necessary**

Monitoring of employees' work is necessary not only for the manager or the
person responsible for project execution but also for the organization's
employees. In this case, the manager knows that they will receive reliable
results, loyalty, and a dependable team. The employees, on the other hand, have
opportunities for professional development, growth, and the potential for higher
and more stable wages. Additionally, control makes requirements and rules clear
to everyone.

The control of employee activities serves to improve various aspects of a
company:

- **Clarity of Expectations:** It makes key performance indicators (KPIs),
  responsibilities, and sanctions clear to employees. This clarity leads to more
  predictable results, fewer task and project failures.

- **Enhanced Trust and Reliability:** Clear expectations and well-monitored work
  lead to trust and reliability in business partnerships and contracts, ensuring
  that the company meets deadlines.

- **Consistent Quality of Work:** Effective monitoring helps maintain a
  consistent quality of work, making the business competitive and highly
  regarded in the market.

- **Better Crisis Management:** Well-monitored teams are more adept at crisis
  management, demonstrating efficient management and reliability.

- **Early Problem Identification:** Monitoring helps detect problems and errors
  at the early stages of project execution, which reduces the cost of rectifying
  deficiencies.

- **Improved Employee Loyalty:** The ability to fairly reward employees based on
  performance enhances their loyalty to the company.

- **Recognition of Success:** Monitoring focuses on successes rather than
  failures, motivating the team and fostering professional and personal
  development.

Employee monitoring is a mutually beneficial collaboration between two parties
that is implemented for the collective good of the organization. It also helps
identify dishonest, lazy, and unmotivated employees who are uninterested in
their work or career. Detecting such individuals in a timely manner helps reduce
theft within the company, identify absenteeism issues, prevent internal
espionage, detect fraudsters, and identify weak links among employees.

What Happens If Employees Are Not Controlled
Any job, even an interesting and well-paid one, remains an employee's
responsibility and requires significant effort. The lack of control
significantly relaxes the team and leads to poor results. Let's take a closer
look at the main problems that arise in the absence of discipline and low levels
of control within a company.

## **Employees Stop Working:**

In the absence of real control, most employees gradually start taking the path
of least resistance: they complete tasks quickly and with low quality, putting
in minimal effort, procrastinating, having tea breaks, and engaging in idle
chatter.

## **Underperforming Employees Go Unnoticed:**

Some employees may appear to be working diligently but may have limited
abilities and potential. Without regular monitoring, it's impossible to track
which employees are missing deadlines due to a lack of qualifications, skills,
or motivation, especially among outsourced team members.

## **Ineffective Managers Are Also Overlooked:**

Some managers may have a high level of knowledge but may not effectively fulfill
their responsibilities due to bias towards employees, belittling them, or
dismissing valuable employees. Some may withhold valuable information beneficial
to the team and the company to receive higher bonuses and to appear better in
the eyes of senior management.

Therefore, a well-structured employee work monitoring system is not a whim of
employers but a necessity. With monitoring, employees have the opportunity to be
objectively evaluated and to independently analyze their contribution to the
company's activities. This increases employee motivation and business
productivity.

## **Types of Employee Monitoring**

There are several types of employee activity monitoring, including preliminary,
final, and stage-by-stage monitoring.

## **Preliminary Monitoring:**

This type of monitoring should not be applied too frequently, as constant
surveillance can be burdensome for employees. However, it can be useful in
specific cases, such as when a new employee is undergoing training in the
company. In such cases, the manager needs to ensure in a timely manner that the
project is progressing in the right direction.

## **Final Monitoring:**

Final monitoring is used to check the ultimate results of an employee's work
when they have already achieved a specific goal or completed a task. This type
of monitoring is conducted based on reports of completed work, project
completion, a successful outcome in a legal case, or the launch of software.

The advantage of this type of control is that it provides employees with a
degree of autonomy, allowing them to feel trusted. This trust encourages
employees to take responsibility for task completion and fosters their
professional development. At the same time, the manager can save resources,
time, and energy and can focus on more critical tasks.

Among the drawbacks of this type of control is the significant risk of missing
deadlines or receiving low-quality work, especially for tasks performed by new
or inexperienced employees. Therefore, this type of control is suitable
primarily for trusted, qualified employees.

## **Stage-by-Stage Monitoring:**

This type of monitoring is used when a task needs to be broken down into
specific stages. Stage-by-stage monitoring guides employees not on the processes
of their work but on the results. It helps minimize the risk of not achieving
the final goal.

How is stage-by-stage employee monitoring applied in work? The administration or
manager divides a task into several logical subtasks. For example, data
collection, problem analysis, finding solutions, selecting one of them, and then
preparing documentation and submitting it to government agencies for
registration. After completing each substage and the final stage, the manager
conducts a review.

Stage-by-stage monitoring of employee work is best suited for large tasks that
require a long time to complete. It is also useful when working with inattentive
employees who are process-oriented and require frequent supervision by the
manager.

## Methods of Employee Monitoring

Certainly, it is essential not to stand behind your colleagues and control their
every move closely. This can lead to tension within the team, stress, and even
negatively impact department performance, ultimately resulting in negative
outcomes. The most effective methods of employee monitoring include:

1. **Creating Conditions where Team Members Watch Over Each Other.** This
   involves fostering an atmosphere of mutual vigilance and support within the
   team. Employees should understand that their colleagues are there to help,
   not to spy on them. This peer support can help in self-regulation and
   maintaining discipline.

2. **Non-intrusive Monitoring, Conducted Without Direct Supervision.**
   Non-intrusive methods such as monitoring tools and software can help track
   employee activities without the need for constant physical supervision. These
   tools can provide valuable data on work habits and productivity.

3. **Combining Both Approaches for Maximum Effectiveness.** Often, a combination
   of these approaches, combining peer support with non-intrusive monitoring,
   can yield the best results. This allows employees to feel trusted and
   respected while still providing accountability.

## How to Organize Employee Monitoring

Effective employee monitoring is organized following the fundamental principles
of efficient monitoring. Here are seven such rules:

1. **Transparency.** Every employee in the company should be aware that their
   activities are being monitored. They should also know which tools are used
   for this purpose, what key performance indicators (KPIs) are evaluated, and
   what consequences await them based on the quality of their work.

2. **Predictability.** A sense of stability and security is crucial for
   productive work. The established monitoring system should be clear and not
   change too frequently. In contrast, constantly changing systems undermine
   their effectiveness and create confusion.

3. **Objectivity.** Monitoring rules for employees should be the same for the
   entire team. Impartiality is the best ally in monitoring. Favoritism has no
   place in the workplace.

4. **Subtlety.** Staying informed about all activities and interfering in every
   project are two entirely different and incompatible processes. A supervisor
   should only act according to a pre-approved plan unless there is an urgent
   situation.

5. **Consistency.** A well-established system is a regular system. If management
   starts monitoring subordinates, they should do it consistently, without
   interruption, and not weaken their observations.

6. **Effectiveness.** Administrative staff, managers, and other top executives
   responsible for monitoring employees should not devote all their time to
   monitoring others. Otherwise, they will simply not have time to perform their
   own tasks, which will affect overall productivity.

7. **Results.** Monitoring for the sake of monitoring achieves nothing. It's
   essential to understand what to do with the results of the monitoring:
   identify effective employees or problem areas, plan further actions, harness
   potential, or rectify shortcomings.

## Mistakes to Avoid

No matter how much a manager strives to increase productivity and improve
employee performance, they can always encounter adverse effects. Common mistakes
made by administrative teams include:

- **Unsystematic monitoring:** Identifying work deficiencies without
  acknowledging team achievements or successes.

- **Monitoring without understanding:** When a manager lacks understanding and
  insight into the work performed by employees.

- **Formal monitoring:** Leading to equally formal actions by employees.

Additionally, unethical methods of monitoring, such as eavesdropping on phone
calls, reading messages, excessive video surveillance, or spying on employees
through webcams, should be avoided. Employee monitoring should be conducted
legally, correctly, and systematically, without overstepping ethical boundaries.
In this case, employees will not fear punishment or termination but will strive
for high performance and productivity, making employee monitoring an obvious
asset.
