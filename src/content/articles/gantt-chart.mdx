A Gantt chart is often used to display tasks and processes in projects. This is
a special tool of project management, realized in the form of two digital axes,
one of which displays tasks, and the other - the time of their fulfillment. It
is convenient for tracking the sequence, priority, and progress of tasks.

This method of project planning is suitable for different areas of activity.
Using a linear tool, it is convenient to control all the work processes
performed within the project. Gantt charts allow you to manage everything in
time and not forget anything. We suggest that you consider the main
characteristic of this gantt chart and find a real application for it.

## What a Gantt chart is and how it works

The authorship of this planning method belongs to Polish engineer Karol
Adamecki. He came up with the idea of displaying work processes as a visual
representation of a diagram.

A little later, the use of a similar form was suggested by the American engineer
Henry Gantt, who worked in the field of military shipbuilding. He developed a
methodology that allowed to graphically display construction activities to
demonstrate the degree of work completion and their percentage of deviation from
the project. This discovery would later become very popular in various fields
and be named in his honor.

Nowadays, Gantt Chart is actively used in project management. This method is
suitable for anyone who wants to learn how to manage their time and affairs.

What is a Gantt chart for in ordinary life or business? It gives an overview of
the following elements of a project:

- Objectives.

- Start and end date.

- Assignment Deadlines.

- The time required to implement them.

- Possible ways to integrate multiple tasks.

- Assigned responsible persons.

You can add any other information that is relevant to the business to the chart.
For example, deadlines (milestones) and so on.

## Where the Gantt chart is used

This tool is most often used in the fields of software development and
marketing. But that doesn't mean that it can't be used in ordinary life. If you
are used to visualizing your tasks, it will definitely be convenient for you.

The advantages of the method include:

- increasing the efficiency of team interaction;

- visualization of tasks and deadlines;

- identifying critical points of the project;

- tracking progress on project tasks;

- organization of personnel workload management;

- optimal planning and distribution of tasks among employees.

A Gantt chart is necessary:

- **When planning large marketing campaigns**. The information displayed on it
  will show employees their areas of responsibility. It will show how the work
  of each of them will affect the overall process.

- **When demonstrating the results of the work to clients**. The method will
  clearly show in what terms it is realistic to fully complete the project.
  Provides information about the necessary actions to be taken for its
  successful completion.

- **When planning a new product launch**. An entire development roadmap can be
  depicted on the diagram. Using a gantt chart, you can prevent possible
  conflicts between tasks. Assume dependencies between project phases.

This method of visualization is suitable for all projects related to the
parallel execution of several tasks. For example, within the framework of
production, products are produced, specialists are trained, and new products are
planned. The Gantt chart allows you to determine which capacities are occupied
and which remain idle. Visual examples help to identify and eliminate
bottlenecks in a timely manner, avoid additional costs and optimize production.

In IT, the use of diagrams to visualize planning helps to simplify collaborative
work on a project. It shows deadlines for each task, specifies responsible
persons, and dates of completion of each stage of work. In the course of joint
work, the team will only have to mark the degree of readiness of tasks and track
possible deviations from the project.

## What a Gantt chart looks like

![what a gantt chart looks like](/gantt-diagramm-1024x372.webp)

Today, specialized electronic applications are used to create line charts, in
which the necessary data are entered. The diagram consists of two scales:
horizontal and vertical. Vertical - it is necessary to describe the tasks to be
solved. On the horizontal - the time required for their fulfillment is
indicated. The arrows between the tasks serve as dependencies, i.e. they
indicate the order in which the work should be followed and done.

The length of the horizontal bars indicating the tasks to be performed at each
stage depends on the deadlines for their realization. To better understand how
to make a Gantt chart, let's look at the different variants of its creation.

Various methods and tools can be used for compilation, ranging from an ordinary
sheet of paper to specialized software that allows you to build a Gantt chart in
an automated mode. Regardless of the method chosen, the following steps should
be followed:

1. Determine the start and completion time of the project.

2. Add start and end times for each task present in the project.

3. Highlight co-dependent elements in a project. Or tasks that cannot be started
   until the previous ones are completed.

4. Specify the milestones of the project. That is, checkpoints by which you need
   to achieve a certain result.

5. Make adjustments in a timely manner when the plan changes.

## Building a Gantt chart on paper

Make a list of the tasks scheduled for completion. Arrange them on a vertical
scale in the order in which they are to be completed. On the horizontal time
axis, display the time divisions indicating the time intervals required for the
final completion of all tasks. Between these axes, draw the tasks as bars,
measuring horizontally the time required to complete them.

Assign a responsible person or several persons to perform the task. Make sure
that the tasks are evenly distributed among them.

This method of construction is suitable for small companies with minimal
production load.

## Excel spreadsheets

Using this simple and popular method, you can effortlessly build Gantt charts in
automation mode. To create a Gantt chart, you enter the necessary project data
into the table and select the linear Gantt option in the menu. The obtained
result is transferred to a convenient place for presentation, and the creation
of Gantt charts is completed by customizing the display.

The data in the tables for the Gantt chart are entered manually. When working
with vast amounts of information, you can use ready-made templates.

## Google Spreadsheets

The working principle of these tables is similar to Microsoft Excel. But the
process of creating a Gantt chart in this service differs from the previous
variant:

1. A table with data for the project is created.

2. The free columns to the right of the table contain the planned dates of the
   project.

3. A gantt chart is drawn in the free field between data and dates allocated for
   construction.

4. The "Conditional Formatting" function is selected from the "Format" menu.

5. In the opened tab select the item: "Add Rule", "Your Formula". In this box
   you enter the address of the first cell of the row with dates, the address of
   the field with the date of completion of the first task and the date of its
   beginning. By substituting in the formula: `= AND(E$1<=$C2;E$1>=$B2)` your
   data, you can create a project diagram.

If all conditions are met exactly, we will get a view in a Gantt chart that can
be shared with colleagues.

## Microsoft Project

## Conclusion

After a brief analysis we can say that visualization of workflows facilitates
project management. It helps to improve team interaction, organize and track the
tasks of each participant. Graphical display of information using a diagram is
one of the most effective planning methods used in time management.

You can create your own diagrams using any number of methods. For example, build
them manually on a sheet of paper, in Word or in Excel spreadsheets. But, it is
more convenient to use special applications for gantt, in which you can quickly
create your own project, assign deadlines, tasks, executors and control its
execution at every stage.
