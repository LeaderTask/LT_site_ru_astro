If you have an iPhone, consider installing an iOS reminder app on it. This piece
of software can act as an alarm, reminding you about upcoming tasks, meetings,
appointments and to-dos. Thanks to it, you'll never miss an important event or
goal and will become more productive. Compared to the native built-in reminder
in your iOS smartphone, such solutions can offer extended functionality and tend
to be more user-friendly. In this overview, we'll list the top reminder apps for
iPhone for all tastes and budgets.

## How to Select the Best Reminder App for iPhone

When choosing an iPhone reminder app, you should focus on these four features:

- Device compatibility. Some apps are compatible not only with iPhones but also
  with other Apple gadgets, such as your Mac or iPad. Others are available on
  Android and/or Windows too. There can be different paid plans for different
  devices.

- Usability. An ideal app is easy to use and has an eye-candy interface.
  However, people's demands can differ greatly. Some users value an uncluttered
  layout as their top priority. Others appreciate customization opportunities
  the most.

- Features. A simple app can let you only add, edit and delete reminders. Its
  more advanced counterparts can allow you to sync the reminders with your
  calendar, change themes and sounds, input the information with your voice,
  manage tasks and projects and so on.

- Price. Some apps are available for free. Others have free plans with limited
  functionality — and if you need more features, you'll need to upgrade to one
  of the paid plans with a monthly or annual subscription.

Below, we'll list the top solutions with good user reviews and large customer
bases. We'll start with the products that are rich in functions — and move to
those that were designed exclusively for reminders.

## LeaderTask

![LeaderTask](/Leadertask_app-1024x716.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.7

🏳️ The most affordable plan: $2.18

👍 Competitive edge: Powerful and versatile

👎 Weak point: Overwhelming functionality

[LeaderTask](/downloads) is much more than a reminder app. It's a versatile
solution for managing your time, tasks and projects, compatible with various
devices and operating systems. It comes in equally handy for private and
business purposes. Reminders are just a tiny part of its functionality — and we
put LeaderTask at the top of our rating thanks to its unique approach to them.

The team behind the app understands well that some users want their reminders to
be as straightforward as possible. This feature in LeaderTask resembles an alarm
clock and exists in the format of push notifications. It can be one-off or
recurring. It's incredibly easy to use it. To set a reminder, you should
pre-define a specific moment in time for it.

Besides, there are notifications. It's not an alarm signal — but an informative
message that will pop up on your iPhone's display as a push notification. You'll
see it as soon as a change occurs in your plans — for instance when you get a
new task from your manager or access rights for a document. Notifications can
let you review your tasks for the day in the morning — and analyze your brief
performance statistics in the evening.

## Any.Do

![AnyDo](/anydo.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.6

🏳️ The most affordable plan: $3

👍 Competitive edge: Extensive functionality

👎 Weak point: Steep learning curve

Just like LeaderTask, it's a powerful and versatile solution, compatible with
various platforms and operating systems. You may start by composing a to-do
list, organizing its contents in chronological order and setting respective
reminders for the list's items. Any.do supports location-based reminders — for
example, when you'll be walking past a veterinary pharmacy, your iPhone will
tell you that it's time to buy a shampoo for your pet. The key drawback of this
product is that you might need time to get used to it.

## Todoist

![ToDoIst](/ToDoist-Planner-1024x655.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.6

🏳️ The most affordable plan: $4

👍 Competitive edge: Gamification of reminders and tasks

👎 Weak point: Reminders are not its main focus

The team behind this app believes that people spend too much time planning
things — and too little time doing things. They delivered their product to fix
this issue. You can conveniently create tasks and set reminders for them. If you
wish, use natural language for this purpose. You'll be able to prioritize items
and share your lists with others. Todoist will gamify your content so that the
process of achieving your goals turns into an enjoyable adventure. The app will
learn your habits and adjust to you. It will measure your productivity and
you'll get a good opportunity to analyze your performance.

On the flip side, it's not the best option for those who want their reminders to
be simple and efficient. There are too many distractions. Besides, the free
version of Todoist is not too impressive — be ready to upgrade to premium to
discover the full scope of features.

## Things 3

![Things 3](/things-1024x768.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.5

🏳️ The most affordable plan: $9.99

👍 Competitive edge: Interesting approach to categorizing tasks into areas

👎 Weak point: No collaboration features

This task management solution is powerful — and at the same time easy to use. It
lets you categorize your to-dos in areas (that is, spheres or niches) and create
projects for each area. Then, you can add tasks to projects, come up with
headings for them, tag them, attach notes to them, compose checklists and set
deadlines. The app can display the information from your calendar in its
interface as well as sync data across all your Apple devices.

The three task management solutions that we mentioned earlier offer
collaboration features — while Things 3 lacks them. Even though it's not the
main focus of our article, we'd like to warn you about this shortcoming.

## Capsicum

![Capsicum](/Capsicum.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.5

🏳️ The most affordable plan: $1.99

👍 Competitive edge: Perfect for setting reminders that form habits

👎 Weak point: Exclusive for iOS

This digital planner allows you to schedule your to-dos, take notes and form
habits. The reminders are habits-oriented — they will help you get used to good
practices and eventually, improve your lifestyle. Feel free to create a
dedicated notebook for each subject and customize it to reflect your individual
tastes. The app can integrate with your calendar so that you'll be able to
review all your plans on a single page.

## Microsoft To-Do

![](/microsoft-to-do.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.4

🏳️ The most affordable plan: Free

👍 Competitive edge: Smooth integration with all the other Google products

👎 Weak point: Limited customization opportunities

There is a curious story behind this product. Previously, there was a rather
popular Wunderlist app for managing your daily to-dos. Microsoft acquired it and
shut it down. In exchange, the brand invites users to try its own To-Do app.
Compared to Wunderlist, it might lack some exciting tidbits — and most of all,
customization opportunities. Nevertheless, its functionality is more than enough
to remind you about your tasks. It's available entirely for free and there are
no paid plans.

Microsoft To-Do is compatible with many different platforms and devices. It
smoothly integrates with all the solutions by the same brand. It will be easy
for you to reach your Outlook tasks from this app — or create them right in the
app. Feel free to compose and edit lists of tasks, set due dates for them, split
large tasks into smaller ones, attach notes to items, prioritize items with
colors and share your content with others. When a deadline approaches, the app
will remind you about it. One of the coolest benefits of Microsoft To-Do is its
Smart Suggestion feature. It memorizes your habits and, over time, reduces your
efforts when typing in new content.

## Google Keep

![Google Keep](/google-keep.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.4

🏳️ The most affordable plan: Free

👍 Competitive edge: Smooth integration with all the other Google products

👎 Weak point: No opportunity to go beyond the basic functionality

It's the obvious choice for Google fans. In the app, you can make notes, compose
to-do lists and set reminders. Reminders can be regular or location-based —
you'll see the latter only when you approach a specific place. You'll be able to
share your content with others to inform them about your plans. This product
will automatically sync all the information that you type into it with your
Google Account.

This app lacks paid plans and you can enjoy all its functionality at no cost. On
the one hand, it's great. On the other hand, it can be a disadvantage for people
who are ready to make in-app purchases to customize their user experience.

## Fantastical 2

![](/fantastical2-1024x512.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.4

🏳️ The most affordable plan: $6.99

👍 Competitive edge: You can link the reminders to your calendar

👎 Weak point: The functionality of the reminders is based on the native iPhone
features

Fantastical 2 is not a reminder app but a calendar one. However, it integrates
with the native reminder app iPhone. It's not necessary to visit the native app
to set a reminder — because you can do it right in Fantastical 2. Thanks to such
a bundle, you'll be able to link the reminders to your schedule's items and
check the schedule for many days ahead in one click. Fantastical 2 supports
natural language input. The design of this app is sleek and modern.

## Clear

![Clear](/Clear.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.3

🏳️ The most affordable plan: $4.99

👍 Competitive edge: Opportunity to add items to your schedule with intuitive
gestures

👎 Weak point: Lack of fancy features

As its name suggests, this app stands out from the rest thanks to its
minimalistic interface. Its target audience is people who feel nostalgic about
the days when they scribbled down the notes with the help of a pen and paper.
Simplicity is the key. Clear enables you to create as many to-do lists as you
wish and set a reminder for each item on your schedule. The app syncs with
Apple's Reminders and lets you select from multiple visually pleasing themes.

## Remember The Milk

![](/remember-the-milk-ipad.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.3

🏳️ The most affordable plan: $49.99 annually

👍 Competitive edge: Cross-platform compatibility and integration with various
services

👎 Weak point: Limited functionality of the free version

It's a rather minimalistic product. Create a task, add a deadline for it and set
a reminder. Remember The Milk can send notifications through multiple channels,
including email, Twitter and text messages. It's compatible with various
platforms and integrates with third-party services. You can share the contents
of the app with other people so that they're aware of your plans.

To have a taste of the app, you may start with its free version. However, its
functionality is limited. Only after you upgrade to premium, you'll be able to
tag your tasks with colors, attach documents to them and benefit from unlimited
storage.

## Due

![](/Due.webp)

💌 User rating: 4.3

🏳️ The most affordable plan: $7.99

👍 Competitive edge: Many themes and notification sounds to choose from

👎 Weak point: Limited functionality

This one is focused exclusively on the reminders. It doesn't double as a time,
task or project management solution. Some users perceive it as an advantage —
and others as a disadvantage.

The interface is uncluttered and you can easily navigate between the features
with the help of swipe-based gestures. After a reminder goes off, you can
deactivate it — or let it repeat in 10 minutes. Feel free to customize your Due
experience by choosing one of the multiple available themes and notification
sounds.

## Final Thoughts

Thanks to a reminder app for iPhone, you'll never forget about your tasks, goals
and plans. This piece of software can act as a one-off or recurring alarm clock.
You can choose an app that offers the most basic reminders — or has more
advanced features to help you better organize your time. When selecting a
product, pay attention to its device compatibility, usability, functionality and
price.

One of the best solutions on the market is LeaderTask. It's a powerful time and
task management tool with excellent reminders and notifications. It's equally
suitable for private and business use and we genuinely recommend it.
