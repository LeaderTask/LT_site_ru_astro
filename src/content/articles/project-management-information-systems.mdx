In 2023, any company, regardless of its field of activity and life cycle of
existence, requires business processes. At the same time, they must be
fine-tuned to ensure the firm's survival in a competitive and flexible business
environment. The same need, in turn, is the ability of the enterprise to respond
rapidly to the changes occurring in the surrounding world.

The company's strategic goals have a unified foundation and common concepts that
ensure targeted forward movement. And project management information systems are
a tool to achieve them. They take into account project risks, optimize the use
of resources, monitor the execution of strategic plans, analyze real indicators
and make adjustments to the progress of work.

It turns out that a project management system is a key component of an
organization's management system that leads to the achievement of the company's
strategic goals. What is the program, how is it implemented and how to choose it
correctly? Let's explore these questions and review the best automated programs
in today's article.

## What are project management systems

First, let's understand what project management is. Project management
information system (PMIS) is an organizational and technological complex of
methodological, technical, software and information tools.

This tool is usually aimed at supporting and improving the efficiency of
functional planning and project management processes based on specialized
software. It should necessarily be recorded and conducted on the basis of common
management processes.

## Objectives of the management system

Such project management systems have been created specifically for:

- growth of the enterprise personnel performance during the project work;

- improving the quality of project management by the management team;

- multiplying the productivity of the organization's project portfolio
  management.

The management systems and subsystems help to accomplish more projects within
the specified time frame and at the same time limited to less budgeting, incur
minimal costs.

## IPMS tasks

The above goals are achieved through certain objectives of control systems. Let
us point out the main ones:

1. Providing the project activity manager with tools for project planning and
   monitoring of project implementation.

2. Providing all team members involved in project activities with understandable
   tools required to accomplish tasks.

3. Provide supervisory tool to department or division manager for quality
   allocation and utilization of staff on project and non-project assignments.

4. Providing data to the manager on decision making on assigning certain
   employees to the next projects, the possibility of redistributing the level
   of workload.

5. Providing a suitable tool for the project director to automate the routine
   and establish end-to-end monitoring of the status of the portfolio of
   projects under implementation, the ability to track the quality of work of
   managers.

6. Provide a unitary dashboard to monitor all projects to the plant manager to
   enable quick process intervention, deviation analytics or decision making.

7. Ability to view the alignment of the portfolio of projects with the company's
   strategy to the company's shareholders.

The main tasks of the project management information system allow to act more
efficiently, as well as to fulfill the project management processes of any
company, depending on its peculiarities, structure and specifics. At the same
time, each participant of the process has the opportunity to observe and
monitor.

## Types of control systems

In most cases, the classification of project management systems comes down to
dividing popular programs into local, client-server and web-based. Some have
both boxed and cloud-based versions. Payment is made either on a one-time basis
or by monthly subscription per user.

Small teams, small businesses are recommended to purchase not too expensive or
conditionally free software located in the developer's cloud. Such platforms
often have the functionality of task managers, maintain client bases and are
successfully engaged in projects.

Medium, large and very large enterprises are better suited to boxed models with
online project management systems. Their functionality is usually broader,
customizable, provides the company with basic needs and is easily adapted to the
activities of any business area.

## Areas of application of the project management system

IPMS have been successfully used in several industries. They achieve the
greatest results in areas such as development, construction and IT, engineering
and consulting services, industry and new product development, and internal
development projects.

However, in other business areas as well, most dedicated project management
systems are easily adapted to industry specifics with advanced functionality and
flexible customization. A PMS (integrated project management system) can be
essential in the public sector, the digital economy and the first phase of
project development.

In the future it can be implemented in the field of construction, providing
comprehensive customer support and effective interaction between project
participants. It can also be implemented in the field of data storage and space
management, where a comprehensive project management system is required for
effective organization of work and interaction between project participants.

Project Management is an essential component of effective business management,
and implementing a project management system can greatly simplify the process.

## Application of project management systems: what are the benefits

Business owners may have a legitimate question: why does a company need a
project management information system? In fact, it has several advantages at
once:

- reduces the number of projects that are not in line with the company's
  strategic line;

- Increases accountability and efficiency in the utilization of firm resources;

- reduces budget overruns;

- reduces the failure rate of project activities;

- minimizes the time costs for project offices and project managers of developed
  projects.

And remember that a business needs only effective tools that can bring it
benefits: financial, resource or reputational. There is no point in worrying
about software that only complicates the company's work or that the company is
not going to use.

## Implementation of the IPMS

Qualitative implementation of domestic project management system in the
practical activities of the enterprise is a large and autonomous organizational
project. It must be managed according to the requirements of the rules of
project management and change management in the firm.

It is desirable to carry out such a project according to an established
standard, consistently following the following steps:

1. Competently initiate project creation by establishing a project manager,
   assembling a working group and preparing an internal implementation plan.

2. Further, incorporate a single management tool (with automation, a single
   repository, a common working environment for discussions) within the
   boundaries of the pilot project, while simplifying rather than complicating
   management processes.

3. In the near future to get initial results, allowing the management of the
   enterprise to make sure of the correctness of the chosen direction, and the
   team to be inspired and get an additional charge of motivation.

A simple way to accomplish the steps correctly is to get a project online portal
that allows project participants to act quickly, in a convenient format, in a
compliant manner, covering the fundamental information needs of the firm as
project activities progress.

## Project management systems: how to choose the right one

Thus, the choice of the right automated system is the main task of many
companies, on which the further realization of the development depends. The
decision should not be made thoughtlessly, but based on the specific
characteristics of the software, its methodologies.

The platform should have a simple and intuitive interface to immediately launch
the main business processes in the company, be easy to implement, and not
require lengthy user training. In this case, the program will not cause
resistance among employees, but will be accepted by employees with gratitude for
simplifying network processes and freeing up calendar time.

In addition, the functionality of the platform should be flexible and easy to
customize, so that the service can be put to work immediately, rather than
having to go through the agony of programming and design. The top tools should
include certain templates that can automate the fundamental processes of the
company. At the same time, the program should be able to be further adjusted as
the company develops.
